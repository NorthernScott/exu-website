# Adventure 1 - Part 1

## Setup

The players are all in Nicodranas. Lucien and Shin know each other well - Shin has been Lucien’s *au pair* since he was small - and they are wandering the market together. Lucien has just completed a successful trade and is flush with cash.

Helga has just arrived in the city, is likewise in the market, and has just bought some roasted chicken for lunch.

Ada and Alarise met on the road 2 days earlier as they were coming through the Wuyun Gates and, since they are both from Zadash they decided to travel together. They entered the city this morning and are in the Open Quay market looking for an inn.

## Introduction

The world of Exandria turns beneath a star-scattered sky, a blue-green jewel floating in blackness. Ancient and alive, it is crisscrossed by veins of power and magic that weave in and through the planes. As we fall into the sky, the white orb of Catha looms in the periphery of our vision, and the red moon of Ruidus shines with twinkling lights, shining amid the dust storms.

It is the year **845 PD**—two years since the Apogee Solstice and fall of Ludinus Da’leth’s apocalyptic scheme to destroy the gods. The world has begun to exhale, unsure if it has emerged from shadow or merely passed into another one.

We continue to fall, the clouds below us parting to reveal an azure sea far below. We see white caps, and dotted islands. To the east, a line of mountains rises up and stretches across the horizon. As the world turns below, we see green jungles at the feet of the mountains, dense and think, but pierced now by fields, towns, and a line of sparkling cities strung like a necklace next to the sea. The **Menagerie Coast**, a tropical sprawl of jungle and city-states, ruled not by kings but by the merchant princes of the **Clovis Concord**. Coral palaces and red tiles roofs glitter under the setting ocean sun.

We fall toward the southernmost jewel of the coast, to Nicodranas. In the harbour, countless white sailed ships come and go and sit at anchor, the lifeblood of a continent crowding the docks. Nearby, a immense tower looms over the water but seems to recede as we get closer. We drop toward streets thronged with people, past a lavish inn with open windows and fluttering drapes, over a carnival stretched next to the water - lanterns aglow with an odd blue light - and toward a market filled with colourful stalls.

It is dusk, and the humid air is starting to freshen as the sun goes down. The air is thick with the smell of salt and spices, fish and flowers, roasting nuts and grilled fruits. The shouts of traders echo through streets slick with ocean mist. Sailors haggle over bolts of silk. Entertainers play for coins, and tavern keepers set out boards advertising the evening meal. And throughout the streets, a gaggle of children run about pasting posters on wooden posts and café walls—**“Moonlit Marvels & Menagerie! Limited Engagement! See the wonders from beyond the sea!”**

The tide is coming in, and lamps are being lit, and the air seems to hum, as our vision narrows to focus on…

## The Moonlit Marvels & Menagerie

### Arrival & Atmosphere

The carnival rolls into Nicodranas just at dusk, stalls and tents unfurling along the boardwalk and spilling into the market square.

Lanterns of bioluminescent jellyfish glow overhead, and a water organ played by a non-sentient automaton plays jaunty but haunting melodies.

Colourful pennants flutter in the harbour breeze; the scent of candied citrus, spiced nuts, and sweet smoke drifts toward curious passersby.

### Ringmaster & Troupe

- **Ringmaster Sylas “Silver Tongue” Caelum:** A dashing half‑elf with silvery hair and an ever‑present grin. He welcomes newcomers with broad gestures and free samples of carnival sweets—though his eyes sometimes flicker with something darker.
- **Key Performers:**
	- **The Pantomime Pack:** A family of five tabaxi clowns who take part in the big-top show and also wander the midway performing tricks.
		- **Silent Paws on Wet Cobbles**, “Silent,” the father.
		- **Many Salmon in the Morning**, “Salmon,” the mother.
		- **Copper’s Loudest Night**, “Copper”, the eldest son, a teen. Named for the night he was born when his Aunt, “Bad Copper Penny,” wouldn’t stop squealing for joy that her sister Salmon was having her first child.
		- **Red Flash of Moonlight**, “Red,” the middle sister, also a teen. Named for the Ruidus Flare under which she was born. During the Apogee Solstice she was drawn to Ruidus but her family tied her down and kept her safe.
		- **Surprise!**, the baby girl, about 9.
    - **Lyra, Virgo, and Thad Flusterbam:** Three gnome acrobats from Westruun. Thad wanted to be a tea merchant but his sisters convinced him to do this instead.
    - **Monash & Fling:** A young bormodo woman and her cytaa who have a knife throwing show. Their telepathic bond allows them to pull off impressive tricks. Monash thinks she’s died and gone to heaven being on Exandria. Fling finds it waaaay too humid.
    - **Brian “Brun the Behemoth” MacDonald:** A gentle orc strongman who entertains with feats of strength—yet refuses to harm even a straw puppet.
    - **Madam Musk:** A strange old woman who sells potions and magical oddities. She will also read fortunes by casting bones. Madam Musk is from Asarius, in the Kryn Dynasty of Eastern Wynandir. It’s not clear what drew her to the coast or how she got here. Madam Musk stays mostly hidden behind thick robes and a hood, and generally does not like people to come close to her. She moves with a strange lack of coordination and her limbs seem somehow too small for her frame. On a >15 perception check, it can be seen that she has a lizard-like snout, but the proportions are all wrong for a dragonborn.

> [!NOTE] Madam Musk
> On a >20 perception or insight check, it can be determined that Madam Musk is actually 4 Kobolds wrapped in robes.
>
> If the players somehow managed to get the full story out of Madam Musk, they would find out that the Kobolds here in Nicodranas are locals. The Kobolds who created the “original” Madam Musk in Asarius have essentially started “franchising” out the concept, with Madams Musk popping up in a variety of places as a way for pro-social and enterprising Kobolds - admittedly a tiny minority - to make a go of it in the free market and support themselves.

### Major Attractions

**The Celestial Menagerie:** An ornate tent filled with a series of gilt cages containing strange, otherworldly beasts:
- A series of exotic but otherwise unremarkable birds and animals.
- **A gilt cage holding a bronze pseudodragon with a tiny bed and many stuffed toys. It could be persuaded to join the group if it was gifted with enough stuffys and broken out.**
- A tank of bioluminescent jellyfish.
- A large cage holding an enormous 12-foot crocodile.
	- *When someone first glances at the crocodile, they will see that it is covered in fur like a beaver and has large, velvet-covered antlers like a caribou, but that image vanishes on a second look.*
- A giant venomous snake.
- A 10-foot by 10-foot iron cage done up like a Victorian sitting room, with a bespeckled Kuo-Toa sitting in a bathtub reading a book on mathematics. Its name is something close to “Trout” and it is perfectly happy being there.
- **A strange “mer-dog” that looks rather like a yellow lab but that can breathe underwater and swim, that has just had puppies, which are for sale for 50 gp each.**

**The Dolphinarium:** An enormous tank of salt water filled with seaweed, coral, fish, and dolphins. It’s free to watch but for 5 gp you can purchase a potion of water breathing and swim with the dolphins for an hour. Run by several merfolk. **There’s at least one wacko who keeps trying to jump in naked to “commune with the dolphins,” and has to be wrestled out.**

**Madam Musk’s Pavilion:** Madame Musk is known as a seer and herbalist of the highest order. She offers cryptic fortunes by casting fish bones into a silver bowl. Among her more exotic offerings are a special selection of teas from someplace called the “Blooming Grove.”

**The Gauntlet:** Midway games of strength, skill, and speed.
- A “high striker.” A roll of 20 or more will ring the bell.
- An archery range. A bullseye can be scored at progressively distant targets with a 10, 15, 20, or 25 attack roll. There’s also a “kiddie target” at 5.
- A 100-yard dash with heats every half-hour.
- A fighting pit.

**Ribald Wreckers:** An hourly 10-minute “Punch & Judy” puppet show.

**Moonlit Menagerie Stage:** A nightly spectacle of bards, illusionists, fire‑eaters, and dancers. Includes appearances by:
- Brun the Behemoth
- Lyra, Virgo, and Thad
- Monash & Fling
- The Pantomime Pack

**Nana Morri’s House:** A crazy, fey-themed fun-house that seems kind of slap-dash. A man in a sun bear outfit who goes by “Sweet Pea” greets new comers and warns them of the wonders within.

### Nana Morri’s House

#### Exterior

The house has a front facade that is carved and painted to look like an enormous tree house. It seems rapidly done but is surprisingly detailed. A man in a sun bear outfit who goes by “Sweet Pea” greets new comers and warns them of the wonders within.

#### Room 1 - The Undermuck

A large swampy room with moss hanging off the walls that is intended to resemble the approach to the enormous tree house. A papier-mache potoo bird circles the room on a track saying “Beware the Fate Stitcher!”

#### Room 2 - The Tiki Bar

The entry hall to the home, done up like a weird Tiki Bar. There are numerous crystal goblets of alcohol. At least one person in the party must drink in order to move forward. Roll a D100 on the wild magic table to determine the effect.

#### Room 3 - The Hall of Mirrors

A passage of mirrors that distort the reflections of the party. As they go by, the catch visions of themselves in different ages and situations, all of which vanish if they look again.

#### Room 4 - The Trickster’s Library

An ornate library with shelves filled with fake books and scrolls. Most of them prove to just be props that are nailed to the shelves but some can be opened some of which pop open with harmless surprises like confetti or fake spiders. If a player rolls >15 on an investigation check to find a “real” book, they will find a magical tome called the “Book of Names.” It has a powerful magical aura but can’t immediately be read.

#### Room 5 - The Topiary Garden

A large topiary garden filled with hedges pruned into incredibly life-like humanoid forms that almost seem to shift as if they are breathing. As the players move into the garden they suddenly realize that they can’t find the exit.

The players must succeed on 3 skill checks to find their way out.

#### Room 6 - Fearne’s Playroom

The players find themselves in something that looks like a child’s playroom. The middle of the room has a wrestling ring made out of towels and linens and surrounded by an “audience” of stuffed toys who come to life. A fully real Sweet Pea the Sun Bear is waiting for them. They must either wrestle him or bargain with him to pass.

#### Room 7 - Morri’s Collection

The players ascend an incredibly tall carved staircase. It is so tall that there is no possible way that it could be contained within the structure at the carnival. They eventually find themselves in front of Sir Push-Pull.

**Sir Push-Pull** is an often chatty door leading into Morri’s Collection, made of woven bones and skull fragments forming a large face. Sir Push-Pull will ask the party to solve a riddle, but will admit them to the room whether they solve it or not, as “Nana would like to see them.”

	“I’ve got no hands, yet I do collect—
	Trinkets and teeth and things you’d neglect.
	I hoard the weird, the warped, the wild—
	From cursed old dolls to a spleen in a vial.
	…
	Morri adores me—I’m dusty, dramatic.
	Say my name right… I’m her *favourite* attic.”

> [!IMPORTANT] Nana Morri’s Quest
> Nana Morri - otherwise known as “the Fatestitcher” - wants the party to help find the Raven Queen. She will give them as little information as possible but if pressed will explain that the threads of fate that she usually “plucks / fucks with” have gone “slack” since the Matron’s disappearance. As much as she find the Matron to be a bore, she *needs* her.
> A successful persuasion or intelligence (skill) check will help the players to conclude that the Matron’s ritual of catatheosis may have impacted her differently than the other gods due to her origin as a mortal. *A further intelligence (skill) check could let them know that this might have implications for other “gods” like Vecna and Tharizdun.*
> If the players threaten Nana Morri she will curse them. With a successful 20 DC persuasion check she will give them a boon.

### Wrap-Up

Once their time with Nana Morri is done, the players find themselves at the exit of the attraction. If they re-enter the attraction they will find all the rooms except room 7, and all of them will be obviously fake.
