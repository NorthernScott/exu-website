# Adventure 1 - Part 1

## Setup

The players are all in Nicodranas. Lucien and Shin know each other well - Shin has been Lucien’s *au pair* since he was small - and they are wandering the market together. Lucien has just completed a successful trade and is flush with cash.

Helga has just arrived in the city, is likewise in the market, and has just bought some roasted chicken for lunch.

Ada and Alarise met on the road 2 days earlier as they were coming through the Wuyun Gates and, since they are both from Zadash they decided to travel together. They entered the city this morning and are in the Open Quay market looking for an inn.

## Overview of Moonlit Marvels & Menagerie

### Arrival & Atmosphere

The carnival rolls into Nicodranas just at dusk, stalls and tents unfurling along the boardwalk and spilling into the market square. Lanterns of bioluminescent jellyfish glow overhead, and a tinkling calliope plays a haunting melody of lilting sea‑shanty notes. Colourful pennants flutter in the harbour breeze; the scent of candied citrus, spiced nuts, and sweet smoke drifts toward curious passersby.

### Ringmaster & Troupe

- **Ringmaster Sylas “Silver Tongue” Caelum:** A dashing half‑elf with silvery hair and an ever‑present grin. He welcomes newcomers with broad gestures and free samples of carnival sweets—though his eyes sometimes flicker with something darker.
- **Key Performers:**
    - **Lyra the Luminous:** A merrow‑touched acrobat whose skin shimmers faintly in moonlight.
    - **Brun the Behemoth:** A gentle orc strongman who entertains with feats of strength—yet refuses to harm even a straw puppet.
    - **Madame Aurette Moonshadow:** A mysterious oracle who reads bones and star‑charts inside a tent draped in violet silks.
- **Major Attractions:**
	- **The Celestial Menagerie:** A series of gilt cages containing strange, otherworldly beasts—a translucent owl whose cries mimic human laughter, a six‑legged fox that seems to flicker in and out of sight.
		- *Hook:* One creature seems to recognize Lucien; it hisses his name.
	- **Phosphorescent Carousel:** A carved wooden ride whose mounts glow softly: a kraken’s tentacle, a hippocampus, a half‑sea dragon.
		- *Hook:* At midnight, the ride spins of its own accord—riders report visions of drowning.
	- **Fortune Teller’s Pavilion:** Madame Moonshadow offers cryptic fortunes by casting fish bones into a silver bowl.
		- *Hook:* She promises Helga a “feast of fire,” and when Helga touches the bowl it burns her palm—no physical damage, but a chilling vision.
	- **Moonlit Menagerie Stage:** A nightly spectacle of illusionists, fire‑eaters, and kelpie dancers.
		- *Hook:* Ada and Alarise spot a familiar Zadashian sigil painted on the stage floor—but it vanishes when they look again.
	- **The Whispering Tent:** A small canvas booth where visitors hear murmured secrets of those nearby.
		- *Hook:* Shin hears Lucien’s au pair secrets whispered back to him—footprints lead behind the tent to a locked trunk.
	- **Nana Morri’s House:** A crazy, fey-themed fun-house that seems kind of slap-dash.

## Carnival‑Themed Adventure Hooks

1. **Disappearing Acts:**

    - Several townsfolk who visited the Menagerie at night vanished without a trace. Lantern‑lit footprints lead into the flooded lower chambers beneath the stalls.

2. **Smuggler’s Front:**

    - The carnival’s exotic beasts are rumored to be smuggled from Xhorhas. PCs can uncover a hidden menagerie crate labeled “Imperial Tax‑Exempt” shipped via Dwendalian agents.

3. **Arcane Malfunction:**

    - One of the illusionists’ prisms shatters during a performance, releasing a flash of wild magic that swaps Lucien’s voice with Brun the Behemoth’s roar. How will they reverse it?

4. **Cult in Disguise:**

    - A small faction of Melora’s worshippers has infiltrated the carnival, using the crowds to spread spores of a mutagenic fungus. If unchecked, the mushrooms will bloom across Nicodranas.

### Next Steps

- **Choose 1–2 attractions** to fully stat out (maps, DCs, NPC stat blocks).
- **Decide which hook** feels most compelling to kick off “Moonlit Marvels & Menagerie.”
- **Determine PC involvement**—will they be ticket‑buyers, backstage pass VIPs, or summoned by Sylas himself?

Let me know which pieces you’d like to dive into first!
