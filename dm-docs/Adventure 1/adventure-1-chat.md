Can you see my notes?

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

### role::assistant<span style="font-size: small;"> (gpt-4.1-mini)</span>

I can only see the messages you send during our current conversation. I don’t have access to any external notes or files unless you share their content with me here. If you want to share your notes, just copy and paste them, and I’ll be happy to help!

### role::user

How can I add my vault to our conversation context?

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

### role::assistant<span style="font-size: small;"> (gpt-4.1-mini)</span>

Currently, I don’t have the capability to directly access or integrate external vaults or documents into our conversation context. However, you can share relevant excerpts, notes, or information from your vault by copying and pasting them here.

If your vault contains a lot of information, you might want to share key sections or summaries to keep the conversation focused and manageable. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
