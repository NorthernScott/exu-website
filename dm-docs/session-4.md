# Session 4: After the Wave

## Plot Hooks

### 1. Why Were We Spared?

Nicodranas has been saved but is reeling from the experience. The question on everyone’s mind is: **Who or what saved us?**

Leading theories include:

#### The Sluiceweave

It was some sort of incredible natural phenomenon, perhaps tied to the Sluiceweave.

**Hook:** The party might find Capt. Marius in the Restless Wharf, looking for old entrances to the Sluiceweave and muttering how about “things haven’t been working right down there for at least ten years.” His men are busy keeping order but he might offer to pay the party to investigate.

#### Yussa Erenis

*Ada*

The visible shield that extended from Tidepeak Tower was only *part*of it’s magical defences, and it was actually the Archmage Yussa Erenis who saved us.

**Hook:** A crowd is gathering at a respectable distance around Tidepeak Tower and people are leaving flowers at its base (because “elves like flowers, don’t they?”). So far they have been met with only silence. The party could push their way through the crown and be invited in by Toger Greytoe who wants their assistance in getting people to leave so that “Master Yussa doesn’t do anything rash when he returns.”

#### The Gods

*Shin*

One of the gods intervened. Leading contenders are the Wildmother, Avandra, and even Kord.

**Hook:** Offerings are being left at the Matron’s Lighthouse. The main temple of Avandra is full of worshippers and Shin, as a visibly marked priestess of Avandra is accosted in the street for blessings.

#### “The Sea Itself”

*Ada*

“The Sea Itself” rose to defend us. This seems to be a popular theory with the fisher population and draws from old myths and legends about strange sea-gods and the like. People speculate that the Kuo-toa attack was also somehow tied to this.

Impromptu shrines to various and sundry “sea gods” are being set up, especially around the docks and homes of fisherfolk.

Ada probably wants to report this back to the Cobalt Soul.

### 2. Wrecks & Mysteries

#### Treasure

*Lucien*

Several ships that were outside the harbour when the tsunami struck were destroyed. It is rumoured that a merchant vessel from Marquette that was carrying spices and other precious cargo might have been among them, and beachcombers are looking for the wreck.

#### Jungle Ruins

*Ada*

The low-lying jungle around the city was also inundated and the things have been uncovered. There are discussions about strange ruins to the south of Raska Lake, deep in the Quoraska Jungle. This is fuelling all sorts of speculation about ties to the tsunami.

#### “Why Weren’t We Saved?”

*Helga*

Refugees from some of the farthest flung farms and villages are entering the city. They are angry and scared with one big thing on their mind: “If the City was spared, why weren’t we?” It starts to dawn on people that there might have been a substantial death-toll in the country side.

By contrast, some of the city-folk are suspicious of the outsiders. “Why weren’t they saved?” For some, the answer could be because “they were not chosen.”

The circus has become a gathering place for these refugees and the carnival folk, including the gentle half-orc strongman, Brun the Behemoth MacDonald, are doing their best to take in refugees.

#### The Matron

Nana Mori and all that nonsense happened.

*Alarise

Alarise has been given a holy task by her god, the Matron of Ravens. Something went wrong with the ritual of Catatheosis, at least for her. Her spiritual essence has been separated from her body since the ritual. She doesn’t know how that could be the case, but she is essentially trapped in the Astral Plane.

She needs someone to find her body and figure out what’s going on. She’s also not sure if her body is a child or not - she made reference to time being weird.

She suggested a possible course of action would be to find her old her laboratory in the ruins of Avaliir (the Necropolis of Avaliir), which is somewhere in the Shattered Teeth. She thinks that there are materials and equipment there that could help. She is having trouble accessing it in the Astral because of the defences she put in place against interplanar threats. She is hoping that someone might have more luck in the material work. The location of her laboratory changes because of the spatial-temporal uncertainty of the Shattered Teeth.

### 3. Other Hooks

- The party met Toger who obviously has a crush on Ada. They mercilessly teased him and Helga called him Little Toe.
- Ada caught a tuna while fishing.
- Sushi caught a lot of fish.
- Lucien spoke in Shin’s mind for the first time.
- Lucien owns a sword that Ada’s parents made.
