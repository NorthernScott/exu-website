# Tree of Unspoken Dreams (Arbor Tacitae Somnia)

You round the counter and—and there, growing down from the ceiling as though the world has been turned upside-down—is a six-foot-tall tree, its gnarled roots curling into the air where they should be buried in soil. Its trunk threads through the floorboards, and its branches spiral out across the dusty shop floor. But the leaves—oh, the leaves—aren’t foliage at all but thousands of scrap-thin pages, each one a fragment of someone’s unspoken thought or unsent letter.

When you reach to touch one, it trembles and emits a faint, trembling sob—tiny, human sobs that echo in the cramped space like a dozen hidden mourners. If you hold a leaf to your ear, you swear you can hear the writer’s heartbeat, the hush of their regret. Pluck it, and the tear-stained paper dissolves into ash that drifts upward and vanishes before it hits the ground.

The air smells of old ink and rain, though no raindrops fall. A soft, keening whisper drifts through the branches: half-remembered names, promises broken in dreams, lovers who never met. And strapped around the base of the trunk is a tarnished brass placard etched in script that unfurls like a scroll: **“Memoria Arborea: Where Lost Words Weep.”**

You stand there, heart pounding, hands trembling—is this a library of sorrow? A monument to regrets long since forgotten? Or a trap for anyone foolish enough to give voice to what they most fear to remember?
