# Session 5: In the Sluiceweave

## Water Redirection Trap

There is a subterranean sewer flowing across the tunnel with a pulse. Three wheels with clock face markings. Each one controls the water direction, magnitude, and frequency respectively.

They turned the direction to 6 (down), magnitude to 1 (low), and frequency to 12 (slow). This will have an impact on the city’s water and sewer system. It’s essentially an outflow valve.

## Balance Trap

A tall, hexagonal chamber where four **iron catwalks** meet at a central pressure gate. Below churns a **deep sump pool**, the water glowing faintly from bioluminescent algae. A single **iron guillotine gate** blocks the far exit. The air is *humid and metallic*, filled with rhythmic clangs like a heartbeat.

- **Four Balance Valves**: massive wheels at the end of each catwalk. Turning one shifts the **weight and flow** inside the chamber (audible as groans of metal and hisses of steam).
- **Central Gate Mechanism**: locked until the system is balanced.
- **Sump Pool**: 20 ft deep; slippery rails along the sides. Anyone falling in must fight currents (Athletics DC 13 each round to avoid being pulled toward grates).

To open the gate, the party must balance all four valves to match the **engine’s rhythm**.

- **Checks**:
    - **Perception DC 13** → recognize that the valves thrum at slightly different tempos.
    - **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 14** or **Wisdom (Insight) DC 14** → deduce that they must be turned in the correct order.
- **Solution**: N → E → S → W, each within one round of the last, to harmonize with the “heartbeat.”
- **Failure**: If two wrong turns occur in a row, the chamber “coughs,” opening sluice vents that flood the sump — water rises 5 ft/round until reset (max 15 ft).

### Trap: Pressure Gate Drop

If anyone crosses the central dais **before the valves are solved**, the pressure gate slams down.

- **Dex Save DC 15** → avoid 3d10 slashing, otherwise trapped under the gate until others crank it up (Strength DC 16 as a group).
