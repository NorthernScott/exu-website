# Session 1

The world of Exandria turns beneath a star-scattered sky, a blue-green jewel floating in blackness. Ancient and alive, it is crisscrossed by veins of power and magic that weave in and through the planes. As we fall into the sky, the white orb of Catha looms in the periphery of our vision, and the red moon of Ruidus shines with twinkling lights, shining amid the dust storms.

It is the year **845 PD**—two years since the Apogee Solstice and fall of Ludinus Da’leth’s apocalyptic scheme to destroy the gods. The world has begun to exhale, unsure if it has emerged from shadow or merely passed into another one.

We continue to fall, the clouds below us parting to reveal an azure sea far below. We see white caps, and dotted islands. To the east, a line of mountains rises up and stretches across the horizon. As the world turns below, we see green jungles at the feet of the mountains, dense and think, but pierced now by fields, towns, and a line of sparkling cities strung like a necklace next to the sea. The **Menagerie Coast**, a tropical sprawl of jungle and city-states, ruled not by kings but by the merchant princes of the **Clovis Concord**. Coral palaces and red tiles roofs glitter under the setting ocean sun.

We fall toward the southernmost jewel of the coast, to Nicodranas. In the harbour, countless white sailed ships come and go and sit at anchor, the lifeblood of a continent crowding the docks. Nearby, a immense tower looms over the water but seems to recede as we get closer. We drop toward streets thronged with people, past a lavish inn with open windows and fluttering drapes, over a carnival stretched next to the water - lanterns aglow with an odd blue light - and toward a market filled with colourful stalls.

It is dusk, and the humid air is starting to freshen as the sun goes down. The air is thick with the smell of salt and spices, fish and flowers, roasting nuts and grilled fruits. The shouts of traders echo through streets slick with ocean mist. Sailors haggle over bolts of silk. Entertainers play for coins, and tavern keepers set out boards advertising the evening meal. And throughout the streets, a gaggle of children run about pasting posters on wooden posts and café walls—**“Moonlit Marvels & Menagerie! Limited Engagement! See the wonders from beyond the sea!”**

The tide is coming in, and lamps are being lit, and the air seems to hum, as our vision narrows to focus on…Helga.
