# The Gods as Mortals

## Overview

The deities of the pantheon of Exandria are extremely powerful beings that represent and control aspects of reality, having because of this followers and servants among mortals.

Many of the known gods in Exandria fled from their original home, Tengar, the Eternal Palace, when it was attacked by the god-eater Predathos. They travelled through the cosmos and eventually arrived on Exandria, which at that time was inhabited by the Primordials and eidolons, although portions of the planet were ordered and beautiful. It is rumoured that at that time, souls would return and be reborn to new life after death.

The newly-arrived Protean Gods and the Primordials existed in peace for some time, during which time the gods brought order to the chaotic portions of the world and then brought forth mortals. Rumours say the cycle of rebirth was broken for these creatures, whose souls now went to dwell with the god they worshipped after death. However, the major deities eventually split into two groups: the Prime Deities (who are generally seen as good or neutral-aligned), who granted magic to mortals and who battled the Primordials who did not wish mortals to attain that much power; and the Betrayer Gods (who are generally evil-aligned) who embraced the Primordials’ chaotic destruction of the mortal races following their gaining knowledge of magic.

## First Thoughts

Some first thoughts:

- Maybe the gods will be likely to be changed as mortals to the degree that they were changed by becoming “real.”
- Encountering Predathos, fleeing Tengar, and coming to Exandria was a deeply traumatic experience for the gods.
- They all had different responses to the trauma, which ultimately led -in part - to their choices during the schism.
- The Betrayer Gods were further traumatized by being cut off from the world after the schism.
	- Or were they? That could just be lies that Asmodeus told. There’s no other indication that the Primes sent the Betrayers anywhere “bad,” just that they removed them from the world.

## Prime Deities

- **[Avandra, the Changebringer](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Changebringer "The Changebringer")**: Goddess of freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and luck
- **[Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Platinum_Dragon "The Platinum Dragon")** (LG): First of the [metallic dragons](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Metallic_dragon "Metallic dragon") and god of justice, honour, and good-aligned dragons
	- In Divergence, one of his chief paladins is depicted as a “happy warrior.” I think that Predathos horrified him but he didn’t despair. I think he came to Exandria and resolved to “be the change he wanted to see.”
	- I don’t expect that his attitude would have changed all that much. Portrayed by Liam in Divergence, he maintained this profoundly good and helpful attitude.
	- I think he’d be out there somewhere in the world just still being that “happy warrior,” quietly doing good and being an unstoppable force for life.
- **[Corellon, the Arch Heart](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Arch_Heart "The Arch Heart")** (CG): Deity of art, beauty, the [fey](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Fey "Fey"), and spring
	- During the Founding, the Arch Heart wandered the lands, spreading magic and raising the forests. The Mother and Father of all elves.
	- I think he was creative and joyful and coming to the “real world” was maybe the best thing that ever happened to him. He was an artist who suddenly found that he could make anything he wanted and spark life that would do likewise.
	- I suspect that returning to Exandria will be just as joyous for him as it was the first time. Though he might be somewhat more chastened from his experiences. When speaking to “Bell’s Hells” he seemed sad and ready for death. But I think he’s irrepressible. I think that he might rebuild something like his club from Aeor, and at least try to limit his ambition for the time being. I definitely think he would hide his identity.
- **[Erathis, the Lawbearer](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lawbearer "The Lawbearer")**: Goddess of civilization, laws, and peace
- **[Ioun, the Knowing Mentor](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Knowing_Mentor "The Knowing Mentor")**: Goddess of learning, [prophecy](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Oracle "Oracle"), knowledge, and skill
- **[Kord, the Stormlord](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Stormlord "The Stormlord")**: God of battle, competition, and storms
- **[Melora, the Wildmother](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wildmother "The Wildmother")**: Goddess of wild nature and the sea
- **[Moradin, the All-Hammer](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_All-Hammer "The All-Hammer")**: God of craft, creation, family, and legacy
- **[Pelor, the Dawnfather](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dawnfather "The Dawnfather")** (NG): God of the sun, agriculture, and summer
	- He’s a complicated guy. “Tough but fair” doesn’t quite do it justice. He is a god of agriculture and creation, depicted as a kind and generous. But he is also depicted as merciless, stern, and inflexible.
	- Commandments of the Dawnfather
		- Be ever vigilant for evil. People are quick to forget the lessons of the past.
		- Help relieve the suffering of the innocent.
		- Deliver the light of the Dawnfather where darkness dwells, and do so with kindness, compassion, and mercy.
	- It would be easy to see him as the reverse of the Great Ruiner, but I think he’s more like the reverse of Asmodeus. I think he has enormous pride and self-righteousness but also care and love.
	- With all of the adversity and horror he’s seen, I could see him breaking bad. When the best fall they become the worst.
- **[The Raven Queen, Matron of Death](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Raven_Queen "The Raven Queen")**, also called the **Matron of Ravens**: Ascended goddess of [fate](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Fate "Fate"), death, twilight, and winter
- **[Sarenrae, the Everlight](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Everlight "The Everlight")**, also called **Raei**: Goddess of redemption, compassion, healing, temperance, and the dawn
- **[Sehanine, the Moonweaver](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Moonweaver "The Moonweaver")**: Goddess of misdirection, love, moonlight, and autumn

## Betrayer Gods

- **[Asmodeus, the Lord of the Hells](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Hells "The Lord of the Hells")**: [Devil](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Devil "Devil") god of domination, and ruler of the [Nine Hells](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Nine_Hells "Nine Hells")
- **[Bane, the Strife Emperor](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Strife_Emperor "The Strife Emperor")**: God of war and conquest
- **[Gruumsh, the Ruiner](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ruiner "The Ruiner")**: God of slaughter
- **[Lolth, the Spider Queen](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Spider_Queen "The Spider Queen")**: Goddess of deceit, shadows, and spiders
