# Session 2

whip 0/45

Capt. Marius -

They want to do research

- They want to find a library or books
- Probably go to Yusa’s tower, Tidepeak
- Probably go to the Matron’s Temple
- We end with alarms in the night and booms in the deep
- They need to explore the sluiceweave; there’s a kuo toa nest there. How and why?
- Want to know what’s up with the docks
- Uk’o’toa
- They wake up to the tide being way to far out, boats beached, alarm bells ringing, and a deep boom underneath them.

Major Domo Artzai Constanz
