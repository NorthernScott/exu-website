# Plot Hooks

## Major

## Minor

## Character Specific

### Alarise Stormshore

Unbeknownst to her, her trinket (stolen from a classmate) belonged to the girl’s father, who was/is a researcher at the Halls of Erudition.

- [ ] Figure out what Alarise’s trinket is or does. 🔽 ➕ 2025-04-21
- [ ] Invent monastic order for Alarise. ➕ 2025-04-13 🛫 2025-04-13 📅 2025-04-20
- [ ] Work with Adam to determine why Alarise has been sent to Nicodranas. ⏫ ➕ 2025-04-13 ⏳ 2025-04-20

### Lucien Sugea

Sugea means “Serpent” in Basque. Lucien’s mother is definitely a warlock of Uk’otoa. ==Is she Avantika reincarnated??== She came to power in Nicodranas due to Uk’otoa’s influence, or at least she believes that to be true.

- [ ] If Lucien’s mother is Pact of the Chain, work on her familiar. ➕ 2025-04-21

What is the source of Lucien’s power? Does it come from Uk’otoa? We know that he can speak Abyssal, but he doesn’t even know that.

- [ ] Work on figuring out the source of Lucien’s power. ➕ 2025-04-21
