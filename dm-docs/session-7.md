# Session 7: The Hunt for Caliban

## Opening Scene: Mob at the Carnival

### Setup
A frightened mob of 30-40 people is attacking the carnival. They're throwing rocks, torches, overturning carts. The mood is volatile - fear from the tsunami has turned into anger.

**Mob Leaders:**
- **Grevus Tann** (human fisherman, 40s): Lost his boat in the tsunami. Shouting "The carnival brought this curse! Strangers and freaks!"
- **Marta Kiel** (half-elf merchant, 50s): Her warehouse was damaged. More calculating - sees opportunity to drive out competition.

**The Pantomime Pack** (tabaxi vampire clowns) are visible trying to escape through the back of the carnival grounds. The mob doesn't know they're vampires - they just see "outsiders" fleeing.

### Carnival NPCs
- **Brun the Behemoth MacDonald** (half-orc strongman): Trying to protect refugees, looking overwhelmed
- **Madame Musk** (elderly fortune teller): Chirping at the mob, ineffective
- **Several refugees** from outlying farms sheltering at the carnival

### Resolution Options

**Calm the Mob:**
- **Persuasion DC 16** (with advantage if they invoke the fact that the carnival helped refugees)
- **Intimidation DC 14** (but risks escalation if failed)
- **Performance DC 15** (distraction/spectacle to diffuse tension)

**Let It Play Out:**
- Carnival sustains significant damage (~500gp)
- Pantomime Pack escapes successfully
- Brun is injured protecting refugees
- Party's reputation with carnival folk improves

**Help the Pack Escape:**
- Creates distraction for vampires
- Pack may remember this later
- Mob still needs to be dealt with afterward

**Stop the Pack:**
- Pack doesn't fight back, just tries to flee
- Will be captured by city guard who arrive 2 rounds later
- Skrang might appear to help them escape

### Aftermath
City guard (led by **Watch Captain Doria Venn**) arrives regardless. She's exhausted, overworked post-tsunami. Disperses mob, takes statements.

If party helped: Doria thanks them, mentions the guard is stretched thin. "Strange things in the city lately."

## Caliban the Djinn: Background

**Who is Caliban?**
A djinn who came to Nicodranas approximately 6 years ago. He's been secretly building influence through three fronts:
1. Smuggling operation (Warehouse)
2. Siphoning magical energy (Sluiceweave)
3. Information network (Tavern)

**His Goal:** Gather enough power/resources to break free of an ancient binding. He needs:
- Magical artifacts (smuggling them in)
- Raw magical energy (from the Sluiceweave ley line)
- Information about planar weaknesses in the city

**Why does Dazz want him stopped?**
Caliban's meddling with the Sluiceweave weakened the city's ancient magical defenses, making the tsunami far worse than it should have been. What actually stopped the tsunami was U'kotoa's intervention - the leviathan used its power to create that barrier offshore. Dazz (as a fey entity) is trying to maintain balance and prevent Caliban from causing further catastrophe. He's also worried about U'kotoa gaining influence through "saving" the city.

**The Larger Picture:**
Caliban's energy siphoning has been going on for 6 years, slowly weakening Nicodranas's defenses. This created a vulnerability that something (or someone) exploited to send the tsunami. U'kotoa's dramatic "rescue" has earned the leviathan goodwill and worship - some Kuo-Toa priests were already worshipping it, and now more people are unknowingly attributing their survival to "the sea itself."

## Location 1: Warehouse in the Skew

### Description

The warehouse sits on a corner lot where the Skew's slanted cobblestone streets meet the salt-stained docks of the Restless Wharf. The building is three stories of weathered teak planks gone grey from sea spray, with a sagging tile roof missing several shingles. A faded sign creaks in the ocean breeze: "Telban Maritime Storage - Est. 839 PD" (Telban = anagram of Caliban). The lie is in the details - no business only 6 years old would look this decrepit.

**Sensory Details:**
- **Smell:** Salt, tar, old fish, and something acrid like ozone
- **Sound:** Creak of wood, distant gulls, muffled voices from inside
- **Sight:** Windows are filthy, making it hard to see in. Wheelbarrow tracks in the mud lead to the side entrance.

**Exterior Features:**

*Front Entrance:*
- Large double doors (12ft high) designed for loading cargo
- Two guards lounging on crates, playing dice (**Jorik** - scarred human with cudgel; **Mara** - lean woman with crossbow)
- They're bored but alert - Perception +3 each
- Challenge anyone approaching: "Got business with Mr. Kallow? He's expecting you?"

*Side Door:*
- Reinforced oak, rusty iron hinges
- Locked (Thieves' Tools DC 13) but the frame is rotted (Athletics DC 15 to force)
- Opens into main storage area near the crates
- Covered by a small overhang - good spot for sneaking (Stealth DC 12 to avoid guard notice from front)

*Roof Access:*
- Can climb exterior (Athletics DC 13)
- Skylight (4ft x 4ft) opens into the main storage area, 20ft drop
- Glass is dirty but intact - can be opened from outside (Thieves' Tools DC 10 for latch)
- Provides view of interior before entry (Perception DC 12 to spot Renz in office)

*Office Window:*
- 8ft off ground, barred with iron (Strength DC 18 to bend)
- Can see inside: cluttered desk, Renz working on ledgers
- Bars are old - could be cut (1 hour with proper tools, makes noise)

**Interior Layout:**

*Main Storage Area (60ft x 40ft):*
- High ceiling (25ft) with exposed rafters
- Dozens of crates stacked haphazardly - legitimate trade goods: textiles, spices, rope, salt fish
- **Contraband hidden among legitimate cargo:** Marked crates have air elemental symbols stamped on underside (Investigation DC 13 to find if looking; DC 16 to notice while just passing through)
- Four support pillars provide cover
- Lighting: dim (two lanterns), many shadows
- **Tactical Note:** Rafters can be climbed (Athletics DC 12), provide height advantage
- **Hazard:** Some crates are unstable - could topple if crashed into (Dex save DC 12 or take 1d6 bludgeoning and knocked prone)

*Office (15ft x 20ft):*
- Separated from main area by wooden partition with glass window
- Interior: Cluttered desk drowning in manifests and ledgers, filing cabinets (one locked), small strongbox under desk (locked, DC 15), single oil lamp
- Renz's personal touches: Half-eaten sandwich, cold tea, anxiety medication vial (he's stressed)
- Door has a bell that jingles when opened
- **Tactical Note:** Glass window can be broken for quick access but alerts everyone

*Secret Back Room (20ft x 20ft):*
- Hidden door behind a shelf of rope coils (Investigation DC 15 if searching; DC 17 if just noticing while moving through)
- Opened by pulling a specific rope (marked with small knot)
- Inside: Climate is oddly cool and dry (preservation magic)
- Contents:
  - **3 wooden crates** (3ft x 3ft each) containing bottled air elementals - glass vessels glowing faintly with swirling blue-white energy
  - **Brass brazier** (2ft diameter) etched with Primordial runes showing wind patterns and djinn binding symbols
  - **Shipping manifest** on small table showing tonight's delivery to "Typhoon's Rest, midnight"
  - **Ritual supplies:** Chalk, powdered silver (200gp worth), essence of air (valuable alchemical component)
- **Magical Note:** Detect Magic shows strong conjuration on bottles, moderate transmutation on brazier
- **Danger:** Breaking a bottle releases the elemental (use Air Elemental stats, hostile, lasts 1 hour)

## Location 2: Place of Power in the Sluiceweave

### Description

The Sluiceweave is ancient - predating even the Clovis Concord. Down here, worked stone from the Julous Dominion era meets natural caverns carved by underground rivers. The air is thick with moisture and the constant music of rushing water.

**Getting There:**

*From the Access Point (same as Session 5):*
- Iron grate entrance near the Open Quay docks (marked on their previous map)
- 10ft drop into main tunnel (ladder rungs are slick - Dex DC 10 or slip)
- Tunnel is 8ft high, 6ft wide, ankle-deep water flowing west
- Carved markers on walls every 50ft (ancient navigation system - History DC 14 to recognize Julous numerals)

*Navigation (15 minutes):*
- Fork at "Marker VII": Take left tunnel (descends steeply)
- Balance Trap room from Session 5: Now properly balanced, water flowing smoothly
- Water Redirection Trap: Someone (Zephyr) reset it - water now flowing toward the Place of Power
- **Perception DC 12:** Strange humming grows louder as they approach - resonates in teeth and bones
- **Perception DC 15:** Faint blue-white glow ahead, flickering like lightning in clouds

*The Approach:*
- Tunnel opens into a larger chamber
- Sound increases - rhythmic thrumming like a massive heartbeat
- Temperature drops noticeably (10 degrees cooler than surrounding tunnels)
- Sense of power - magic users feel static electricity on their skin

**The Chamber (Confluence of Three Waters):**

A circular natural cavern, 40ft diameter with 30ft domed ceiling dripping with mineral formations. Three water channels enter from different directions (north, southeast, southwest) and converge in a whirlpool at the room's center before draining through grates.

*Central Feature - The Pillar:*
- Ancient stone column (6ft tall, 2ft diameter) rises from raised platform in exact center
- Pre-Divergence construction - seamless stone covered in flowing Primordial script
- Warm to touch (blood temperature), vibrates with power
- Script glows faintly blue-white, pulsing with the water flow
- **Primordial Translation:** "Four winds carry, four waters flow, one heart protects all"
- **History DC 16:** This is Julous Dominion work - part of the city's original magical infrastructure, possibly defensive wards
- **Arcana DC 18:** This is a ley line anchor - it channels magical energy to protect the city from natural disasters (storms, earthquakes, tsunamis)

*The Censers (Caliban's Addition):*
- Four brass censers (3ft tall, ornate) positioned at cardinal points, exactly 12ft from pillar
- Each burns with smokeless flame, consuming incense mixed with powdered gems
- Connected to pillar by faintly glowing lines of energy (only visible with Detect Magic)
- Creating a ritual circle that's actively draining energy from the pillar
- Smoke rises but doesn't dissipate - seems to be drawn into the ceiling

*Water Behavior (Affected by Draining):*
- Flows in unnatural patterns - occasional spirals, water climbing walls briefly
- The central whirlpool spins backward every few minutes (counter to normal flow)
- Droplets from ceiling sometimes fall upward
- **Insight DC 13:** This isn't how water should behave - the natural order is being disrupted

*Environmental Details:*
- **Lighting:** Bioluminescent moss (dim green light) + pillar's blue-white glow + censer flames (amber)
- **Sound:** Rushing water, thrumming vibration, occasional crack of displaced energy
- **Smell:** Wet stone, incense (sandalwood and something acrid), ozone
- **Atmosphere:** Oppressive, watching, the sense of an ancient thing being wounded

*Tactical Features:*
- Platform around pillar is 5ft higher than main floor (requires climb or jump)
- Water channels are 3ft deep, fast-flowing (Athletics DC 12 to cross without being pushed)
- Stalactites on ceiling could be shot down (AC 15, 5 HP each, falls deal 2d6 damage in 5ft radius)
- Four support pillars (natural stone formations) provide half cover
- Grates in floor can be pried open with tools (Strength DC 16) - leads to deeper channels, dangerous
- Damp stone - Acrobatics/Athletics checks at disadvantage unless stated otherwise

### The Magical Working

**What's Happening:**
Caliban has been siphoning energy from this ley line nexus. The censers are part of a ritual to channel power into himself.

**If Detect Magic:**
- Pillar: Strong abjuration and evocation (ancient city defense)
- Censers: Moderate conjuration (active siphoning)
- Water: Faint transmutation (being altered)

**Arcana DC 15:** Recognize this as a ley line confluence. The censers are draining energy elsewhere.

**Arcana DC 18:** The city's magical defenses (including the tsunami barrier) draw from this point. Siphoning energy here weakens those defenses.

### Secrets & Clues

**Secret 1 - The Censers:**
Each censer is made of brass etched with Primordial script. Inside: burning incense mixed with powdered gemstones.
- **Arcana/Religion DC 13:** This is a djinn ritual, channeling elemental air energy
- Taking or disturbing censers will alert Caliban (but stops the drain)
- Each censer worth ~100gp

**Secret 2 - The Pillar:**
Ancient pillar is part of original Nicodranas infrastructure, possibly pre-Divergence.
- **History DC 16:** This might date to the Julous Dominion era
- **Primordial script:** "Four winds carry, four waters flow, one heart protects all"
- Rubbing or sketch could be valuable to scholars

**Secret 3 - Recent Activity:**
- Footprints in silt (humanoid, barefoot - genasi?)
- Dropped copper coin stamped with air elemental symbol
- Scorch marks on ground forming circular pattern (ritual space)

**Secret 4 - Connection to Water Trap:**
If they examine the water flow and recall the trap from Session 5:
- **Investigation DC 14:** The trap they altered has been re-adjusted
- Someone came here after them and changed it back
- Current setting is directing water TOWARD this chamber, feeding the ritual

### Encounter (if they disturb censers)
15 minutes after censers are disturbed:
- **Caliban's Lieutenant arrives:** **Zephyr** (Air Genasi, Female)
  - Use **Priest** statblock (MM 348) but replace spells with:
    - Cantrips: *gust*, *shocking grasp*, *thunderclap*
    - 1st: *feather fall*, *thunderwave*, *witch bolt*
    - 2nd: *gust of wind*, *warding wind*
    - 3rd: *call lightning*, *wind wall*
  - Accompanied by **2 Air Elementals** (MM 124)

- **Zephyr's Goal:** Recover or repair the censers, drive off intruders
- **Tactics:** Uses wind spells for battlefield control, elementals for direct combat
- **If reduced to <15 HP:** Attempts to flee via *gaseous form* (if given it) or surrender
- **If captured/defeated:** Knows Caliban is at the tavern tonight, expecting a shipment

## Location 3: The Typhoon's Rest (Tavern in Restless Wharf)

### Description

The Typhoon's Rest hunches between a ship chandler's and a rope-maker's shop on Wharf Street, three blocks from the docks proper. It's a two-story building of salt-stained planks with a slate roof and shuttered windows glowing orange with lamplight. The sign - a ship in a tempest - swings on rusted chains, creaking in the ever-present sea breeze.

**Talk to Patrons:**

Eavesdropping on Jack or convincing informants:
- A "special delivery" arriving at midnight via boat
- Will be brought through the tavern to the cellar
- Jack is nervous because "the boss is coming personally"

**Secret 2 - Caliban's Plan:**
Piecing together clues from room, letter, and ritual circle:

---

## The Midnight Shipment (If Party Waits)

If the party stakes out the tavern until midnight:

**Arrival:**
- Small boat docks at private pier behind tavern
- **3 smugglers** unload crates
- **Jack** meets them at back door
- **Caliban has not arrived yet** - he's been delayed (by Zephyr reporting the Sluiceweave intrusion?)

**Options:**
1. **Ambush:** Fight smugglers and Jack
2. **Infiltrate:** Sneak and observe/sabotage
3. **Wait for Caliban:** He arrives 30 minutes later if nothing goes wrong

### Combat: The Shipment Ambush

**Enemies:**
- **"Gentleman" Jack Rainer**
  - Use **Bandit Captain** (MM 344)
  - +2 Rapier (finesse)
  - Has *potion of gaseous form* to escape if needed

- **3 Smugglers**
  - Use **Bandit** (MM 343)
  - Armed with clubs and daggers
  - Will surrender if Jack falls

**Environment:**
- Fighting on docks: 5ft deep water on one side
- Crates provide half cover
- Boat can be cut loose or used for escape

**If Caliban Arrives:**
Use **Djinni** statblock (MM 144) but:
- He's weakened by the binding: 100 HP instead of 161
- He will not fight to the death - will retreat if reduced to <30 HP
- Carries a brass amulet (the binding object) - breaking it frees him fully

---

## Backup Combat: Elemental Ambush

If the party doesn't trigger combat elsewhere, Caliban sends assassins to eliminate them:

**Setup:**
While traveling between locations (you choose when):
- 2 **Invisible Stalkers** (MM 192)
- Sent to kill the party quietly
- Attack with surprise if possible

**Tactics:**
- Focus on spellcasters first
- Use invisibility to reposition
- One grapples while other attacks

**Treasure:**
Each carries a platinum collar (50gp) marked with Primordial rune of binding

---

## Wrapping Up Session 7

### Possible Endpoints

**Low-Key Ending:**
- Party gathers intelligence from one or two locations
- Learn about Caliban's plan
- Set up for Session 8 confrontation

**Medium Ending:**
- Party disrupts one operation (warehouse or Sluiceweave)
- Combat with lieutenants
- Caliban knows they're coming

**High-Energy Ending:**
- Midnight ambush at tavern
- Potential confrontation with Caliban himself
- Major escalation

### Cliffhanger Options

1. **Caliban Appears:** If they've disrupted enough, he confronts them directly - session ends as initiative is rolled
2. **City Crisis:** The Sluiceweave energy drain causes another magical surge - water/elemental chaos
3. **Betrayal:** Dazz appears, reveals his true agenda isn't quite what he said
4. **The Pack Returns:** Skrang or the Pantomime Pack show up needing help - or offering it

---

## Notes & Reminders

**Character Hooks:**
- **Ada:** The ley line nexus in Sluiceweave is perfect for her scholarly interests; Cobalt Soul would want to know
- **Alarise:** Elemental creatures are aberrations against natural order; Matron might have interest in binding magic
- **Helga:** Plenty of opportunity for intimidation and smashing things
- **Lucien:** Jack Rainer might know his mother; smuggling connections
- **Shin:** Protecting the innocent carnival-goers; Caliban's disruption of city defenses endangers people

**Loot Tracking:**
- Amber from Session 6: ~1000gp
- Possible from Session 7:
  - 4 censers (100gp each)
  - Bottled air elementals (dangerous but valuable)
  - Jack's rapier (+2)
  - Various coins/gems from encounters

**XP Considerations:**
This should be a substantial investigation with potential for multiple encounters. Budget 3-4 hours of play.

## Plot Connections & Bigger Picture

### The U'kotoa Connection

**What Actually Happened with the Tsunami:**
- Caliban's 6-year energy drain weakened the city's defenses (the ley line anchor in the Sluiceweave)
- This made Nicodranas vulnerable to magical assault
- Someone (possibly U'kotoa cultists?) triggered or amplified a natural tsunami
- U'kotoa then "saved" the city by creating that offshore barrier
- This gives U'kotoa credit, worship, and influence

**Lucien's Mother - The Marquess:**
- She is a secret follower/warlock of U'kotoa (possibly Avantika reincarnated?)
- She WANTS U'kotoa to gain power and influence
- She's been watching Caliban's operation through Mara (the guard at warehouse)
- **When she learns about the party's quest:**
  - Will be suspiciously enthusiastic and supportive
  - Might offer resources, information, or aid
  - Could invite them to the Palace to "discuss strategy"
  - May try to steer them toward confronting Caliban directly (chaos serves her purposes)

**Why the Marquess Supports Stopping Caliban:**
1. Caliban weakened defenses, but the job's done - no need for him anymore
2. His continued presence risks discovery of the larger plot
3. If party stops Caliban, U'kotoa still gets credit for saving city
4. Removes a rival power player (djinn vs. leviathan)
5. Party becomes useful tools she can manipulate

**Red Flags for Players (above the table):**
- Why is a powerful noble so interested in helping adventurers?
- Why does she care about some djinn smuggler?
- Her questions might probe too deeply into their methods/discoveries
- She might discourage them from investigating the Sluiceweave's true purpose
- If Lucien mentions this, she might get very interested in the ley line anchor

**Lucien's Position:**
- Caught between party and mother
- Doesn't know about her U'kotoa connection
- Might notice her unusual interest
- Could become suspicious if she's TOO helpful

### Connection to Other Plot Threads

**The Matron's Quest (Alarise):**
- Caliban's binding magic might be relevant to the Matron's trapped state
- The brass amulet binding Caliban could be studied
- Rasha (djinn hunter) might know about planar entrapment
- The portal circle in tavern cellar uses similar principles to astral travel
- **Potential hook:** "If we can understand how to break bindings..."

**Ada's Summoned Entity (Book of Names):**
- Ada summoned something from the Book of True Names in Session 1
- It's still out there, unnamed, growing in power
- Caliban's portal work involves summoning/binding
- The ritual components in warehouse might help Ada contain what she summoned
- **Danger:** If Caliban's portal opens, it could provide a doorway for Ada's entity
- **Clue:** If Ada examines the portal circle, Arcana DC 16 recognizes similar binding patterns to what was in the book

**The Kuo-Toa and U'kotoa:**
- The Kuo-Toa they fought in Session 5 were worshipping U'kotoa
- They were in the Sluiceweave, near the ley line anchor
- **Possible connection:** Were they sent to protect/weaken that location further?
- The amber they looted might have value to U'kotoa cultists
- Selling the amber could attract unwanted attention from the cult

**Dazz's True Agenda:**
- Dazz is fey - motivated by balance and debt
- Stopping Caliban restores some balance, but...
- Is Dazz aware of the U'kotoa connection?
- Does he have his own agenda regarding the leviathan?
- **Twist potential:** Dazz might reveal he knows about U'kotoa's role but can't directly oppose a god-tier entity

**The City's Ancient Defenses:**
- The ley line anchor predates the current government
- Very few people know it exists (maybe the Marquess does?)
- The Cobalt Soul would be VERY interested (Ada should report this)
- Restoring the anchor's power could prevent future attacks
- **Long-term quest:** Strengthen the city's magical infrastructure

### Foreshadowing for Session 8+

**If Players Stop Caliban:**
- U'kotoa's influence continues to grow unchecked
- Marquess becomes more boldly involved with party
- Kuo-Toa cultists become more active
- Strange ocean phenomena increase (preparation for U'kotoa's release?)

**If Players Ally with Rasha (Djinn Hunter):**
- She wants to capture Caliban, not kill him
- This conflicts with Dazz's mission
- Could lead to complex negotiation/betrayal
- Might reveal information about City of Brass politics

**If Caliban Escapes:**
- He goes into hiding but continues plotting
- Might seek revenge on party
- Could become reluctant ally against U'kotoa later (enemy of my enemy)
- Opens up "hunt the djinn" storyline

**The Bigger Conspiracy:**
- Who actually triggered the tsunami?
- Was it natural, or was it orchestrated?
- Is the Marquess working alone or part of larger U'kotoa cult?
- What is U'kotoa's ultimate goal - just freedom, or conquest?
- Why now, 2 years post-Apogee Solstice?

### NPCs Who Know More Than They're Saying

1. **The Marquess** - Knows about U'kotoa, possibly orchestrated tsunami, watching Caliban
2. **Mara (warehouse guard)** - Reporting to someone at Palace, knows about all three locations
3. **Rasha (djinn hunter)** - Knows Caliban's background, might know about binding magic
4. **Captain Marius** - Sent party to Sluiceweave - does he suspect more than he's saying?
5. **Dazz** - Fey know things, might be playing longer game

### Seeds for Future Sessions

- **Session 8:** Confrontation with Caliban, decision about his fate, Marquess makes her move
- **Session 9+:** U'kotoa plot advances, maybe Kuo-Toa attack again, cult activity increases
- **Long-term:** Matron's body quest, Ada's summoned entity resurfaces, ancient defense system needs repair
- **Wild card:** What if breaking Caliban's binding requires the Book of True Names? Ada's danger + Alarise's need = forced cooperation with dangerous magic

## Roleplaying the Marquess (When She Learns About the Quest)

### When/How She Finds Out

**Through Mara (most likely):**
- Mara reports back after warehouse encounter
- Marquess knows party is pursuing Caliban before they even finish investigating

**Through Lucien:**
- He might mention it casually at dinner
- "Oh mother, we've been hired to stop some djinn smuggler"
- She has to control her reaction

**Through Palace Connections:**
- Watch Captain Doria reports adventurers asking questions about warehouses/smuggling
- Spy network picks up their investigation

### Her Initial Reaction (in private)

- **Relief:** Caliban's usefulness has ended, now he's a loose end
- **Calculation:** How can I use this?
- **Caution:** Don't be too enthusiastic - that would be suspicious
- **Opportunity:** This party could be valuable tools

### Her Approach to the Party

**First Contact:**
- Summon them to Palace "for a private discussion"
- Formal but warm - treats them as equals (unusual for her)
- Lucien is present but confused by her interest
- Offers refreshments, comfortable seating - wants them relaxed

**Her Questions (seemingly innocent):**
1. "Who hired you for this task?" (wants to know about Dazz)
2. "What have you discovered so far?" (assessing how much they know)
3. "Did you find anything in the Sluiceweave?" (VERY interested in ley line anchor)
4. "Has this djinn posed a direct threat?" (gauging if they know about tsunami connection)

**Her Offers (TOO generous):**
1. Access to Palace resources (maps, records, "anything you need")
2. Financial support (200gp "discretionary fund")
3. Palace guards as backup "if you need muscle"
4. Information from her spy network about Caliban's movements
5. Legal immunity for any "necessary actions" (blank check for violence)

**Her Suggestions (steering them):**
- "This sounds dangerous - you should confront him directly, end this quickly"
- "Don't waste time investigating - we know he's guilty"
- "The Sluiceweave sounds unstable - best to avoid it"
- "I can have my people seal those tunnels after you're done" (prevent future investigation)

**Red Flags in Her Behavior:**
- Asks about Sluiceweave multiple times
- Discourages thorough investigation
- Pushes for violent confrontation
- Unusually interested in their methods/discoveries
- Wants detailed reports (ostensibly to "help")
- Avoids questions about city defenses or tsunami
- If they mention "ley line anchor" she goes very still, then changes subject

### Specific Dialogue Examples

**Opening:**
> "Thank you for coming. Lucien has told me a little about your... activities. I understand you're pursuing a dangerous criminal - this djinn, Caliban?" *leans forward, intense focus* "I want you to know you have the full support of this office."

**If they're suspicious:**
> "You seem surprised by my interest. Let me be frank - Nicodranas nearly drowned a week ago. Any threat to our city's safety is my direct concern. This Caliban has been operating in MY city, under MY watch. That's... personal."

**If they mention the Sluiceweave:**
> *visible tension* "The ancient waterways? Dangerous place. Did you find anything of note down there?" *pause* "Any... unusual structures? Old mechanisms?"

**If they tell her about the ley line anchor:**
> *goes very still* "A ley line anchor. How... fascinating. The ancients did such remarkable work." *recovers* "Obviously this is critical infrastructure. Perhaps, after Caliban is dealt with, we should discuss securing that location. Can't have just anyone accessing it."

**Lucien's Confusion:**
> Lucien: "Mother, why are you so interested in some smuggler?"
> Marquess: *sharp look* "Because he endangered MY city and MY people. Including you." *softens* "I won't have criminals operating with impunity. These heroes are doing the work the guard is too overwhelmed to handle."

**Her "Generous" Offer:**
> "I'm prepared to offer substantial support. Gold, information, resources. All I ask in return is regular reports and... discretion. Some matters of state are sensitive. I trust you understand."

### What She DOESN'T Say

- Anything about U'kotoa
- That she knew about Caliban before
- That Mara works for her
- Her interest in the weakened defenses
- Connection between tsunami and Sluiceweave
- Her plans for the party after Caliban is gone

### How to Play Suspicion

**If Players Push Back:**
- She backs off gracefully
- "I apologize if I've overstepped. I'm simply concerned for the city."
- Doesn't rescind offers - that would be suspicious
- But becomes more guarded in future interactions

**If Players Accept Her Help:**
- Provides exactly what she promised (she keeps her word)
- Uses it to track their progress
- Prepares for next phase of her plans
- Starts considering them as potential assets vs. potential threats

**If Lucien Notices:**
- She has private conversation with him later
- Spins it as "maternal concern for his safety"
- Might use this to probe what he knows
- Could create tension between Lucien and party if he sides with her

### After the Session

**If Caliban is Stopped:**
- Publicly praises the party
- Privately moves to consolidate U'kotoa's influence
- Offers them another "job" soon (Session 8 hook)

**If Caliban Escapes:**
- "Disappointed" but understanding
- Offers continued support for hunting him
- Secretly doesn't care - he's not her priority anymore

**Either Way:**
- She's now actively interested in the party
- They're either useful tools or potential problems
- Sets up complex relationship for future sessions
