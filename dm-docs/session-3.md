# Session 3: The Rising Sea

There is a Tsunami incoming.

Shin takes the cursed book that Ada found and then goes to collect the guests.

Skill Challenge to get out of the Palace to safety.

- Helga uses Danger Sense. Athletics check to pick up Ada and Alarise to go faster. **21** succeeds.
- Lucien uses Dexterity to run quickly through the hall. **18** succeeds.
- Ada uses Investigation to find the best way through the halls. **11** fails.
- Alarise uses Perception to find a doorway out of the palace. **21** succeeds.
- Shin uses History to use her knowledge of the city to find a good way to safety. **22** succeeds.
- The group succeeds.

They have several options for where to go:

- The Mother’s Lighthouse, which is very close but potentially exposed.
- Tidepeak Tower, which is almost as close as the lighthouse and protected, but they might be denied admittance.
- The Matron of Raven’s Temple in the Skew, which is farther but safe because it is on the hills.
- The Wildmount Wildlings Adventure Camp, which is farthest but very safe and provisioned.

They choose the Matron’s Temple. They are separated from Shin. From the hills of the Skew, they see a massive shield spell emanate from Tidepeak Tower and surround all of the Open Quay.

They see a shield extend from Tidepeak Tower and surround the Open Quay.

Lucien drops. He encounters Uk’o’toa as a massive eye in a vision. He senses a presence next to him that manifests as a human-sized shimmer in the air. Lucien doesn’t know that Uk’o’toa is Uk’o’toa or what it is. Uk’o’toa says “Mine?” and then there is a moment before it says “Mine.” Lucien then awakes on the road, coughing up and vomiting sea water. Shin finds him on his hands and knees like this. She casts “Lesser Restoration,” which does nothing, and “Protection from Good and Evil,” which immediately makes him feel better and clears his lungs of water.

The tsunami hits some sort of invisible barrier just outside of the harbour. It is massive, hundreds of meters tall, and the water froths against this barrier that protects the entire city. Eventually the water drains and then gently refills the harbour.

## 1. The Matron’s Temple (Temple of the Raven Queen, in the Skew)

**Who do they meet:**

- **Sister Thana**, an elderly, one-eyed monk, sharp-witted, skeptical, and kind beneath the gruffness.
- **Rev. Haim Cortho**, an erudite and kind man who is the leader of that temple.

**What happens:**

- Alarise undergoes a ritual of communion
- It fails. She cries.
- Then the Matron appears to her in Astral Projection, standing in the doorway from the stone cavern ritual hall to the corridor.
- She advises that something went wrong after the ritual of catatheosis, at least for her.
- She - her spiritual essence - has been separated from her body since the ritual. She doesn’t know how that could be the case.
- Her spiritual self is essentially trapped in the Astral Plane.
- She needs someone to find her body and figure out what’s going on.
- She’s also not sure if her body is a child or not - she made reference to time being weird.
- She suggested a possible course of action would be to find her old her laboratory in the ruins of Avaliir, which is somewhere in the Shattered Teeth. She thinks that there are materials and equipment there that could help. She is having trouble accessing it in the Astral because of the defences she put in place against interplanar threats. She is hoping that someone might have more luck in the material work.
- The location of her laboratory changes because of the spatial-temporal uncertainty of the Shattered Teeth.

## 2. In Town

Shin buys a lead box for the Evil Tome of Names. It will be ready this afternoon and shipped to the Palace. Cost is 6sp.

Shin also buys a lock from a specialty jeweller in the Opal Archways. 4gp.

They go fishing. Sushi starts fishing by teleporting into the water with her jaws around the fish.

## 3. The Marquess’ Palace (Lucien’s Home)

**Who do they meet:**

- The **Marquess**, aloof and carefully composed, seemingly unbothered by the tsunami.
- Capt. Marius, who is confused but relieved. He suggests investigating the Sluiceweave, the network of sewers and waterworks beneath the city.

**What happens:**

- Lucien tells his mom about his experience of his vision and throwing up water.

  He explains that he was floating in the void and saw the golden orb. Doesn’t say anything about the eye, or the “Mine,” or the shimmer. Focuses on the physical aspects of the experience and Shin’s intervention.

- Lucien looks for Artzai but doesn’t find him right away and kinda gives up.
- The Marquess is angry with Shin because Lucien was in danger, but bribed Shin with 500gp and obliquely threatened her order and family.
