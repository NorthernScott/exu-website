# Session 6: The Sluiceweave, Part Deux

## Plot Hooks

### The Kuo-Toa Priests

- Clearly they were worshipping U'kotoa.
- Unclear how much they had to do with the Wave.
- The huge chunk of amber is totally inert. They just thought it looked cool. To the wrong buyer it's useless and kinda cheap. To the right buyer (a jeweller or magician) it's worth about $1000 gp, depending on negotiation.

### Skrang

- They encounter a pathetic creature - a Revenant - feeding on rodents.  He tells them that he agreed to be turned because he was sick and afraid of dying now that "the gods are no more."
- Can potentially lead the group to a franchise of (mostly) pro-social Vampires.
- The Vampires he is familiar with are the Pantomime Pack of clowns from the circus.
- They are very guarded but if clearly outed they are mostly happy to discuss their condition and indicate that they were turned in Port D'Amali.

## Story Beats

- Ada's identify spell is "Al" from *Quantum Leap.*
- Shin's Detect Good & Evil is a thermal imaging overview from a video game, with different things highlighted in different colours.

## Events

- Alarise attacked Skrang and tried to kill but he got away and crawled through a crack.
- Ada was nice to him. 
- Lucien yelled at Shin and Alarise to stop.

Quest from Dazz
- Stop the Djinn Caliban
	- Warehouse in the Skew
	- "Place of Power" in the Sluiceweave
	- Tavern in the Restless Wharf
- Get 3 boons
	- "Change", +1 Ensorceled Warhammer (Shining Smite)

A mob then attacks  the carnival. The tabaxi vamps are trying to escape.
