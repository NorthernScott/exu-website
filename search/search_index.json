They have proportionally long arms with long fingers that are tipped in claws, broad shoulders, and long necks. Their faces are pointed, resembling a shark, with dark iridescent purple eyes, nose slits, and a small mouth with pointed teeth. They have deep red skin with striations around major muscles, long arms darker in colour, and silvery veins. At least some reilora exhibit a degree of sexual dimorphism, with hex mind females having a finer bone structure and a divided head crest. As reilora age, their head crests grow and become more prominent, and their skin becomes grey and less intensely coloured.</p> <p>The Weave Mind spent several hundred years genetically manipulating the reilorans to eventually create at least 4 known types: Hex Minds, Juggernauts, Shrikes, and Thought Eaters.</p> <p>At least some reilorans have innate psychic and magical abilities. It is unknown whether these are natural to the species, or the result of genetic or magical enhancement.</p>","tags":["culture","geography","history"],"boost":3},{"location":"world/Locations/doralle-village/","title":"Doralle Village","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"world/Locations/zadash/","title":"Zadash","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"world/Locations/Nicodranas/","title":"Nicodranas","text":"","tags":["city","geography","location"]},{"location":"world/Locations/Nicodranas/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Nicodranas is the easternmost port city in the Menagerie Coast.
