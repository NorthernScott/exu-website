# Nicole - Barbarian

- Goliath barbarian named Helga (she/her), possibly Wildheart
- She derives her strength from her identification with wild animals
- Her rage is more animalistic than angry; she’s not an angry person
- Stone Giant ancestry; comes from a more mountainous area
- Slavic accent
- Comes from a small village where folks keep to themselves; somewhat isolate; predatory animals; farming village; value strength and self-reliance.
- She had to guard livestock from predators
- **Why did she leave her village to become an adventurer?** Could be something happened in the world that caused the village to disband or move? A “sillier” alternative is that she doesn’t feel she has any good marriage prospects at home and is out in search of a strong man and maybe a future?
- Thinks it would be hilarious to have her eventually fall in love with a really weak wizard. Maybe a love triangle between her, a nerdy guy, and an Adonis?

# Spencer - Sorcerer

- Aberrant Mind Sorcerer is top of mind.
- Second or third son of a rich, noble family.
- Expected to perform some familial duty and is either bad at it or hates it?
- The aberrant mind class could speak to him being too weird.

# Lindsay

- Spellcaster (wizard, druid, or cleric)
- Comes from a royal family who is in hiding. There was an uprising/coup and everyone scattered. Xe’s Evil Uncle took over.
- Xe ended up alone somewhere foreign, and trusted the wrong person who took all xe’s money.
- Now Xe is out for revenge and looking for a way to avenger xer family and/or restore them to their throne.
- *Twist: What if xe finds out that xer family was bad not good and that xer uncle rebelled to bring down a tyrant?*

# Adam

- Monk, rogue, ranger or similar #factions
- Maybe more of a utility player?
- What is your background?
- What made your leave / what is your motivation?

# Beth

- No clue yet.
