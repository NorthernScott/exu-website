# Expectations

1. We treat each other with respect and we don’t make fun of each other or of our character choices.
2. We make decisions by consensus.
3. If we’re uncomfortable with something at the table, we address it openly and honestly at the table or in private with our game master. If someone else is uncomfortable, we listen to them, and act with compassion.
4. We do our best to play monthly on a weekend, with Sundays strongly preferred.
5. Our sessions start around 9 am or 10 am, last around 6 hours and go no longer than 7 hours.
6. We play at a mutually agreed location. We do our best to accommodate our different transportation needs.
7. We have food as a part of our games, either individually or as a group.
8. We do our best to attend all our games, to show up on time every time, and to stay for the entire session.
9. If we’re going to be late or can’t make it, we do our best to give at least a week’s notice, or as much as we can, knowing that sometimes, “life happens
10. We want to have fun socialising, but we also want to prioritise making progress on the campaign.
