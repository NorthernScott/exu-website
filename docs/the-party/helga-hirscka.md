- Goliath
- Barbarian
- 25 years old
- 7-8 feet tall
- Intended Subclass: Path of the Wildheart
- Trinket: A single caltrop of bone. She carved it out of a bear bone. She has a set of dice made from the same bone. She made this because she had extra bone.
	- “She believes that every young girl should have her own set of dice carved from bear bones.”
- Soldier Background, because she helped to guard the livestock.
- Feels like she’s “aging out” of marriageable age.
- Ki’Nau, from Doralle Woods, village near the lake.
- Goliath barbarian named Helga (she/her), possibly Wildheart
- She derives her strength from her identification with wild animals
- Her rage is more animalistic than angry; she’s not an angry person
- Stone Giant ancestry; comes from a more mountainous area
- Slavic accent
- Comes from a small village where folks keep to themselves; somewhat isolate; predatory animals; farming village; value strength and self-reliance.
- She had to guard livestock from predators
- **Why did she leave her village to become an adventurer?** Could be something happened in the world that caused the village to disband or move? A “sillier” alternative is that she doesn’t feel she has any good marriage prospects at home and is out in search of a strong man and maybe a future?
- Thinks it would be hilarious to have her eventually fall in love with a really weak wizard. Maybe a love triangle between her, a nerdy guy, and an Adonis?
- Doesn’t really want to get married, it’s just “the next thing” and she hasn’t questioned it yet.
- Parents are dead, just of old age and/or disease.
- Has a younger brother, 15 years old.
- She’s left him in the village but he is far from alone.
- Their village is very communal.
- She is “looking for a spouse,” but really she is avoiding marriage.
- She is a worshipper of Kord, god of storms and strength and bravery.
	- She wants to be strong, self-reliant, brave.
	- She is looking for something but doesn’t know what
	- “She wants to live in the woods with her chickens and wrestle bears.”
	- “Kind of a Ron Swanson type.”
	- She is Lawful Neutral, so she actually is big on rules
- She’s recently arrived in Nicodranas and finds it very overwhelming and weird. She feels very out of place.
- She has a certain amount of disdain for the people, and thinks the men are weak and soft. But is also intrigued by the comforts of the place.
- Really think that the party should meet at the Lavish Chateau.
