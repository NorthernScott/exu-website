### Where Is She Now?

- She’s recently arrived in Nicodranas and finds it very overwhelming and weird. She feels very out of place.
- She has a certain amount of disdain for the people, and thinks the men are weak and soft. But is also intrigued by the comforts of the place.

## Description

![Photo Not Submitted|200](../assets/images/photo-missing.png){ width=200, align=right }

Helga is 7-8 feet tall.

## Personality

Helga comes from a solid place, built on foundations of rock and stone. She believes that people, places, and things should be solid too.

- value strength and self-reliance.
- She derives her strength from her identification with wild animals
- Her rage is more animalistic than angry; she’s not an angry person
- She is a worshipper of Kord, god of storms and strength and bravery.
	- She wants to be strong, self-reliant, brave.
	- She is looking for something but doesn’t know what
	- “She wants to live in the woods with her chickens and wrestle bears.”
	- “Kind of a Ron Swanson type.”
	- She is Lawful Neutral, so she actually is big on rules

Helga has always wanted to help, and her size, focus, and ferocity made her a natural soldier. Starting in her early teen years, Helga was given the job of guarding the village’s livestock. Actually, she wasn’t so much “given” the job as she just started doing it one day.

At first, some of the men of the village laughed at this “little” girl of about 12 who grabbed a spear and started patrolling the pasture. They stopped laughing the day the dire wolf showed up. Six feet tall, twelve feet from tip to tail, and with canines 4 inches long, the beast was huge and an enormous threat. The shepherds fled immediately, leaving the goats and cattle behind, utterly forgetting the girl who insisted on accompanying them most days.

When they returned with a posse almost two hours later, they found the flock intact and unharmed. Helga, meanwhile, was sitting calmly next to a large fire, the carcass of the dire wolf dressed, hung, and skinned, and the hide drying so it could be tanned.

## Relationships

| ------------ | ---- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Brother      |      | M15        |            | Lake Doralle Village |
|              |      |            |            |                      |
|              |      |            |            |                      |

## Family

When people ask Helga where she’s from, it’s hard for her to answer because, as far as she knows, her village has no name. Her Ki’Nau people simply called it “our village.” Over time she’s started referring to it as Lake Doralle Village, since it is located on the shore of the biggest lake in the Doralle Wood, at the feet of the western slopes of the Cyrios Mountains.

Helga’s parents have both passed. Her mother died of consumption about 8 years ago, when Helga was 17. Her father died only two winters ago, taken by an avalanche during the Apogee Solstice.

==What’s the deal with Helga’s brother?==

## Affiliation

==Ki’Nau - what does that mean to her?==

## Quest

> [!NOTE|inline end] Trinket
>
> A single caltrop of bone. She carved it out of a bear bone. She also has a set of dice made from the same bone. She made this because she had extra bone. Why? Because she believes every young girl should have her own set of dice carved from bear bones.

Feels like she’s “aging out” of marriageable age.

She is “looking for a spouse,” but really she is avoiding marriage.
