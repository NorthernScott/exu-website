## Family

Alarise had a ‚Äútypical‚Äù upper middle class upbringing. Her parents, who are alive, work as scribes, providing accounting services to the wealthy business owners of Zadash society. Alarise is an only child; her parents weren‚Äôt even sure that they wanted one kid and decided to stop after her when she proved to be something of a handful.

As a child, her parents enrolled her in a private school run by a clerical order devoted to the Matron of Ravens. They chose the school largely because of its reputation and because she could live at home while attending. They certainly did not expect her to become a devotee of the Goddess of Death--let alone a monk--and probably think that this is ‚Äújust a phase.‚Äù That said, they are happy that she is doing something with her life, even if they don‚Äôt get it.

> [!INFO|inline end]+ Trinket
> A small, rectangular piece of metal, slightly smaller than a snuff box, with two silver metallic cups on one end. It throws sparks when wet. Basically a 9-volt battery. She stole it from the house of a girl she didn‚Äôt like while at a house party in school. Unbeknownst to her, the object belonged to the girl‚Äôs father, who was/is a researcher at the Halls of Erudition.

## Affiliation

Alarise is a member of ‚Ä¶

- [ ] Invent monastic order for Alarise. ‚ûï 2025-04-13 üõ´ 2025-04-13 üìÖ 2025-04-20

She enjoyed the religious community at the school and found it deeper and more honest than much of her own upbringing. When she reached adulthood, she chose to pursue a monastic life largely because she wanted to remain part of the community.

The clerics of the Matron are not an ascetic order. They subscribe to a ‚Äúwork hard / play hard‚Äù philosophy. They are also not a cloistered order, though they do keep to themselves somewhat. However, some of their ranks can be found throughout society filling various roles and generally contributing.

## Quest

Her order sent her to Nicodranas.

- [ ] Work with Adam to determine why she has been sent there. ‚è´ ‚ûï 2025-04-13 ‚è≥ 2025-04-20

Being in such a free-wheeling, colourful place has filled her with some tension. On the one hand, she is a young, energetic, and eager woman who is thrilled to be somewhere exotic and fun. On the other hand, she‚Äôs experiencing some culture shock and feeling a bit overwhelmed. The experience has also mixed her up, making her question her vocation just as she was coming to truly identify with it.

> [!HINT]- What is her quest?
> Why WAS she sent to Nicodranas? Is her order looking for the Raven Queen in mortal form? Are they gathering intelligence on something? Why send a monk from Zadash all the way there? Maybe a mixture of ‚Äúgetting her out of the house,‚Äù while also filling a specific need they had?
