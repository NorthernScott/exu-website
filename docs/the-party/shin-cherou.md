### Where Is She Now?

## Description

![Photo Not Submitted|200](../assets/images/shin-cherou.png){ width=200, align=right }

Shin stands just under six feet tall, her orange‑tinged skin marked with faint tribal tattoos signifying her devotion to Avandra. Her auburn hair is braided close to her scalp, and she wears simple clerical robes reinforced with leather bracers etched with the symbol of the Life Domain.

## Personality

Shin is patient, nurturing, and pragmatic. She believes in uplifting others through compassion and small acts of kindness. Though her childhood was marked by hardship, she carries an unshakable optimism and a firm belief that everyone can change for the better. In the face of danger, she instinctively protects those weaker than herself.

## Family

Shin grew up as the eldest of three children in a modest hobgoblin fishing family. Her parents’ livelihood depended on the ebb and flow of the tides; they instilled in her a strong work ethic and an eye for opportunity. Money was often scarce, and Shin remembers nights listening to her parents’ worried whispers over meagre catches and mounting debts.

She has a younger sister, now 30, who is level-headed and responsible, and has stayed with their parents. Shin also has a “baby” brother, now 22, who has become a shiftless punk who “doesn’t appreciate anything.”

Shin also has a tiny awakened shrub that she simply calls “Shrub.” Shrub lives in a small pot that Shin carries strapped to her back and speaks Sylvan. She regularly prunes Shrub, rather like a bonsai.

## Affiliation

Shin was drawn to the Church of the Changebringer at age 12, when Avandran missionaries passed through offering hope to struggling coastal families. Her natural talent for healing and her empathetic spirit caught the attention of the Marquis’s Chaplain, where she was taken under the church’s wing. When the new Marquess rose to power, she remained, becoming a trusted cleric assigned to the Marquess’ house.

Not long after she noticed the young Lucien, then about 7 or 8, and found that he reminded her of her baby brother. She naturally gravitated toward looking after him, and quickly became his chief tutor and governess. Even though he is now grown, Lucien’s mother generously supplements Shin’s clerical earnings to continue being almost a “paid friend” to Lucien.

As Lucien has grown, Shin became aware of his burgeoning sorcerous powers even before he did. They first began to manifest when he was about 10, when Shin was 26. She likely knows more about his powers than he does; however, she is unclear about their origin. She knows that he hasn’t been studying magic and can tell that he is not drawing from a divine source. This gap in her knowledge has left her deeply concerned that he is some sort of warlock
