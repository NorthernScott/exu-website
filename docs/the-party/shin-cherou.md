## Family

## Affiliation

- Born and raised in Nicodranas
- Oldest of 3 children. Two younger siblings, a sister and a brother.
- Her parents are fisherfolk.
- Her family is frugal and somewhat opportunistic. They instilled a belief in trying to get ahead.
- Some missionaries of Avandra recruited her into the church as an Acolyte at 12 years old.
	- Her family was barely getting by. She had one younger sister and then a newborn boy arrived.
	- She heard her parents arguing about money a lot.
	- She wanted to do something to help her family, as well as being drawn to the enthusiasm and excitement of a change.
	- She showed an aptitude for helping people to become their better selves and was eventually spotted by the Marquis and assigned to his chapel.
	- “I’ve been told I’m a good influence.”
	- When the new marquess took over, she’s just stayed.
	- Somehow attached to Spencer’s family’s chapel, maybe drawing a salary of some kind
	- Lucian reminds her of her younger brother and she naturally gravitated toward looking after him.
	- She became one of his tutors.
	- Lucian’s mom asked her to look after him. Like a paid friend.
	- Shin 100% knows more about Lucian’s powers than Lucian does. “He certainly hasn’t been studying wizard magic, and he’s not faithful enough to be granted spells by Avandra. In fact, I KNOW that Avandra isn’t the source of his power.”
	- She is “Happy” for him for his power, but is deeply concerned that he could be a warlock of some kind.
	- His powers manifested first when he was about 9-11. Shin was about 26.
	- She is certainly feels like he’s a younger brother.
- Her younger brother (22M) is a punk who doesn’t appreciate anything.
- Her younger sister (30F) is more level-headed. She probably stayed home to help out.
- Has a tiny awakened shrub. Speaks whatever Beth’s main language is.
	- She prunes it regularly like a bonsai.
	- Name: Shrub
