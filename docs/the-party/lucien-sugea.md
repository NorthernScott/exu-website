### Where Is He Now?

Lucien has just completed his first successful business deal and is on top of the world. His next goal is to “get out into the world” and “take his business on the road,” but for now he hasn’t *quite* made it out of the Opal Arches. To his credit, he is trying his best to be disciplined, but he is allowing himself some time to celebrate.

## Description

## Personality

Lucien would be a fairly typical “shitty rich kid” were it not for two important distinctions: his mother is the Marquess of [Nicodranas](../world/Locations/Nicodranas/index.md), and he is a sorcerer. To his credit, he *mostly* doesn’t exploit his sorcerous abilities for personal gain, or at least that’s what he tells himself. What is becoming harder for him to ignore is that he seems to have a preternatural ability to convince people of things.

Lucien would tell you that his greatest attachment is to cold, hard, cash; but that isn’t entirely true. That’s not to say that he doesn’t love gold. He does. But his deepest desire is to prove himself by succeeding in ways that his parents - especially his mother - will recognize and reward.

## Relationships

| Relationship        | Name                          | Gender Age     | Occupation | Location   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Mother              | Liderra Sugea                 | F45, Half-Elf  | Marquess   | Nicodranas |
| Father              |                               | M48, Half-Elf  | Fisherman  | Nicodranas |
| Younger Brother     |                               | M8, Half-Elf   | N/A        | Nicodranas |
| Teacher, Au Pair    | [Shin Cherou](shin-cherou.md) | F34, Hobgoblin | Priestess  | Nicodranas |
| Mother’s Major-Domo | Artzai Constanz               | M52, Human     | Major Domo | Nicodranas |

## Family

The centre of Lucien’s family is his mother, who is the Marquess of Nicodranas. However, this is a relatively new development. Lucien’s family were sailor merchants, prosperous certainly, but not among the ruling elite. This all changed suddenly in about 4 years ago when his mother ascended to the throne of Nicodranas very suddenly and through somewhat obscure means.

Unlike Lucien’s mother, his father is very much not a political animal. Still a rough and ready sailor at heart, he has taken to spending a lot of time at sea on his original fishing boat, which he has lovingly restored by hand.

Lucien’s younger brother, who just turned 8, is somewhat of a non-entity in Lucien’s world and spends most of his time hanging out with their dad.

The final member of Lucien’s family isn’t actually a blood relative, though to Lucien she might as well be: [Shin Cherou](shin-cherou.md) is his “au pair”, his teacher, and his companion.

## Affiliation

Lucien would tell you that he is a “lone wolf” or a “solo operator.” However, as a member of the Sugea Family, he is one of the ruling elite of Nicodranas and has close ties with the [Clovis Concord](../world/factions/clovis-concord.md).

## Quest

> [!NOTE|inline end] Trinket
> A tear-dropped shaped silver earring, with a hole in the middle, with a blue teardrop shaped cut glass gem in the middle, containing some sort of liquid. Stolen from his mom.

Lucien wants to do “it” on his own. What exactly “it” is isn’t yet clear to him or to anyone else, but for the time being he has turned his attention to business. He wants to succeed on “his own terms” and “under his own power” - phrases used by his parents - but that’s hard when your family literally runs the trade guilds in one of the most prosperous cities on the continent.

## Notes

- For his 18th birthday, his mother gifted him with a [Cloak of Many Fashions ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/27041-cloak-of-many-fashions).
- He thinks that Shin doesn’t know the full extent of his abilities, but she definitely does.
- He keeps having dreams about drowning.
