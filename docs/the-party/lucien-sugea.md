## Personality

- Sugea means “Serpent” in Basque.
- His mom is definitely a warlock of Uk’otoa.
	- Is she Avantika reincarnated??
- Aberrant Mind Sorcerer is top of mind.
	- His power is somehow connected to Uk’otoa.
	- His mom made some sort of a deal with Uk’otoa to gain power?
	- He probably doesn’t know where his power comes from or about his mom’s deal.
- Second or third son of a rich, noble family.
- Trinket: A tear-dropped shaped silver earring, with a hole in the middle, with a blue teardrop shaped cut glass gem in the middle, containing some sort of liquid. Stolen from his mom.
- Shitty Rich Kid.
- Gives only child energy but has one much younger brother, name unknown, about 8 years old, who hangs out with dad.
- Mom is the Marquess of Nicodranas.
- His dad is a rough and ready sailor.
- Only allegiance is to cash?
- Expected to perform some familial duty and is either bad at it or hates it?
- The aberrant mind class could speak to him being too weird.
- Has the Cloak of Many Fashions.
- Menagerie Coast.
- Avandra - the Changebringer - is their patron deity.
- Speaks Abyssal but doesn’t even know it.
- 17-19 years old
- Keeps having dreams about drowning.
- Edgelord?
- Shin is his “Cool Babysitter,” cool teacher, neat older sister.
- His family were sailor merchants, reasonably prosperous, but not among the upper echelon of the Nicodranian society. This all changed suddenly in the past 3-5 years when his mother ascended to the throne of Marquess very suddenly and through somewhat obscure means.
	- It’s not that he isn’t curious about how his mother did this, but it’s all kinda vague and the stories don’t really hang together.
	- His father is still very much a sailor at heart and is not a political animal. He owns a ship (more than one) and has taken to spending a lot of his time at sea.
- He wants to do “it” on his own. What that means exactly is kinda non-specific.
	- Probably wants to succeed in business, but doesn’t want to do it within the context of his family because he wants to do it himself.
	- He has at this point just completed his first successful business deal and is on top of the world.
	- He may not have even made it out of the Opal Arches.
	- Now that he has some money of his own, he is trying to be disciplined, but is also celebrating. Second generation wealth.
- His earliest connection with his abilities was his ability to convince people of things. He can consciously cast magic but hides it. He thinks that Shin doesn’t know the full extent of his abilities.
- Is his mom arranging marriages for him? Does she even care?
- He’s not really interested. Maybe he turns off suitors?
