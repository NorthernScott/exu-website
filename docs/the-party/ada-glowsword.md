## Description

![Ada Glowsword|300](../assets/images/ada-glowsword.png){ width=300 }

## Personality

> [!NOTE|inline end] Trinket
> A small box of different buttons that she collected from around her parents’ workshop. Like collecting rocks, she took them because they were shiny and pretty. Now she keeps them because they remind her of her family.

Ada is curious to a fault, and this often gets her into trouble. She becomes easily fascinated by random and often esoteric topics. Ada is quirky, a touch weird, unencumbered, and enjoying her life as - essentially - a grad student. Unlike the rest of her family, she isn’t crafty by nature, but her keen mind means that she has absorbed a lot of knowledge about crafting over the years. She’s not particularly competitive, but puts a lot of pressure on herself to succeed.

## Family

Ada comes from a working-class family originally from Hupperdook. Her grandparents moved to Zadash independently as children, met as “teens,” fell in love, and started a family.

Ada is on good terms with her family but doesn’t see much of them because of how busy she is and how busy they are. Her father trained as a blacksmith and her mother became a seamstress. They combined their talents to start making armour, and quickly became renowned for the quality of their work.

Now, the Glowsword Smithy is one of the most prestigious manufacturers of armour and weapons in Wynandir. They have kept the business small, with only a handful of apprentices and assistants. As a result, their production volumes are small, with each piece being personally fashioned at least in part by Ada’s parents and commanding a substantial price.

Ada’s older brother “Dim” is apprenticing with their parents, and has started studying arcana to hopefully one day be able to enchant some of their wares.

Their family maintains a respectful rivalry with [Sparkhammer Smithy](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Sparkhammer_Smithing), another weapon maker in Zadash.

## Affiliation

Ada presented herself to the Zadash Reserve of the Cobalt Soul at age 13, precocious and whip smart. Initially bemused, the librarians let her into the library, and quickly realized her intelligence. Ada started spending every day at the library from dawn till dusk, and after a year an Arcanist accompanied her home and asked her parents if they would consent to the Cobalt Soul training her. Despite having no contact with the Cobalt Soul, her parents thought that the discipline and the opportunity to learn might be beneficial for her and consented.

Ada showed an aptitude for magic and was placed under the mentorship of [Onde Orsal](../npcs/onde-orsal.md), a young half-human and half-orc wizard at the Cobalt Soul. For her part, Ada thought it was cool to be accepted because it was a recognition of her intelligence, but she doesn’t have a particularly strong attachment to the Cobalt Soul.

Since completing her basic arcane education about a year ago, Ada has started to specialize in Abjuration, with a focus on extraplanar incursions (rather like a paranormal investigator).

## Quest

The Cobalt Soul has sent Ada to Nicodranas to investigate reports of extraplanar incursions, and with not much more information than that. Since there is no Cobalt Reserve in Nicodranas, she was sent via teleportation circle to [Tidepeak Tower](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Tidepeak_Tower), the home of archmage Yussa Errenis, a member of the Arcana Pansophical.

She arrived in Nicodranas about two weeks ago, and the first person she met was Yussa’s apprentice, a very cute dwarf named [Toger Greytoe](../npcs/toger-greytoe.md), who has oddly bumped into Ada almost every day that she’s been in Nicodranas.
