# Yussa Errenis

## Stat Block / Role

Somewhat friendly contact of Ada Glowsword, who is at least assisting the Cobalt Soul in their efforts to control and study extraplanar incursions.

## Appearance

A striking high-elf with dark skin and white curly hair pulled back into a tight bun. He has chiselled features, though there are some crow’s feet wrinkles that are creeping in to show his age. He is shorter than an average elf, standing at around 5 feet, or a little less. He usually wears Prussian blue robes with intricate gold brocade trim, and gold jewellery. Like all elves, he appears ageless. And hot.

## Personality

Yussa is incredibly shy and secretive, rarely venturing outside of his tower in the Open Quay. He primarily relies on his personal assistant, [Wensforth](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Wensforth "Wensforth"), to take care of his business, and very rarely grants audiences to ordinary people. He has a great love for drinking tea. Yussa appears not to care about the morality of his actions, and believes that the means are always justified if the end is to preserve balance and peace.

## Motivation

The accumulation of knowledge. Personal freedom.

## Notable Possessions

### Tidepeak Tower

The [Tidepeak Tower](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Tidepeak_Tower) is a mage tower located in the centre of the Open Quay in the port city of Nicodranas. It belongs to Yussa Errenis who is also the owner of the Open Quay.

Lying in the the centre of the Open Quay, Tidepeak is a singular 450 foot tall massive tower that looms over the entire district. It has a diameter of 90 feet and has no doors or windows. It has a number of small balconies dotted around the tower and it comes to a slight roofed peak that is a sharpened point. It is made of dark and light-flecked emerald stone. It sticks out, and there are no buildings up against it.

The tower seems to have some sort of permanent illusion cast over it which makes it appear smaller at a distance, and grows to its full height when approached. This enchantment allows the tower to seem unobtrusive and inconspicuous on the Nicodranas skyline. A different illusion makes the balconies look like paintings, becoming more solid and real whenever they’re being used.

### Heirloom Sphere

Also known as “[The Archmage's Bane](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Heirloom_Sphere),” the Heirloom Sphere is a wondrous object that “contains” or accesses one or more pocket dimensions that are known as “The Halls of Halas,” and constitute the private sanctum, study, and home of the Archmage Halas. The Heirloom Sphere was given to him by the Mighty Nein.

### Soul Stone of Halas

A ruby containing the soul of the Archmage Halas (given to him by the Mighty Nein and currently locked in a pocket dimension).
