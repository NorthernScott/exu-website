# Yussa Errenis

## Role

Somewhat friendly contact of Ada Glowsword, who is at least assisting the Cobalt Soul in their efforts to control and study extraplanar incursions. May have tasks to perform or knowledge to sell.

## Appearance

![Archmage Yussa Errenis|200](../assets/images/yussa-errenis.png){ width=200, align=right }

A striking high-elf with dark skin and white curly hair pulled back into a tight bun. He has chiselled features, though there are some crow’s feet wrinkles that are creeping in to show his age. He is shorter than an average elf, standing at around 5 feet, or a little less. He usually wears Prussian blue robes with intricate gold brocade trim, and gold jewellery. Like all elves, he appears ageless. And hot.

## Personality

Yussa is incredibly shy and secretive, rarely venturing outside of his tower in the Open Quay. He primarily relies on his personal assistant, [Wensforth](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Wensforth "Wensforth"), to take care of his business, and very rarely grants audiences to ordinary people. He has a great love for drinking tea. Yussa appears not to care about the morality of his actions, and believes that the means are always justified if the end is to preserve balance and peace.
