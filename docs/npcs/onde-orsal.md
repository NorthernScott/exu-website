# Onde Orsal

## Role

The mentor and teacher of Ada Glowsword.

## Appearance

![Onde Orsal|400](../assets/images/onde-orsal.png){ width=400, align=right }

A young half-human / half-orc abjurer of the Cobalt Soul, stationed at the Cobalt Reserve in [Zadash](../world/Locations/zadash.md). There is an ongoing debate among the student body as to whether he should be called “McDreamy” or “McSteamy.”

## Personality

Sweet and almost painfully shy, there was a time when Onde was routinely underestimated. However, he has since become skilled and hot. He is highly intellectual and seems completely unaware of the effect he has on many of the students and quite a few of the other faculty and members of the Reserve.
