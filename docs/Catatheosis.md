# Overview

The **Rites of Catatheosis** are a powerful and unique working of arcane, divine, and [dunamantic]([[Dunamancy]]) [magic](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") by which the souls of [deities](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Deities "Deities") become bound to [Exandria](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Exandria "Exandria") and its cycle of rebirth, allowing the divine entities to regain their identity and some of their powers eventually, but remaining mortal and thus undetectable for threats such as [Predathos](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Predathos "Predathos").

In 843 PD, during the crisis that followed the [Red Solstice](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Apogee_Solstice "Apogee Solstice"), [Bells Hells](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Bells_Hells "Bells Hells") were encouraged by [the Arch Heart](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Arch_Heart "The Arch Heart") and [the Raven Queen](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Raven_Queen "The Raven Queen") to challenge the divine status quo using the God Eater, either as a tool of negotiation or as a way of forcing the divine beings out of Exandria. Having determined that Predathos didn’t seem to sense mortals, the gods were persuaded to take mortal forms as they had done [in the past](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Downfall "Downfall"), becoming invisible to their natural predator. The gods dismantled the Divine Gate, and the [[Matron of Ravens]] created and executed the ritual of Catatheosis, drawing in part on the power of [the Luxon](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Luxon "The Luxon").

The Rites of Catatheosis were designed using the [Rites of Ascension](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Ritual_of_Seeding "Ritual of Seeding") as a reference, combined with the knowledge of the Raven Queen about mortal incarnation and the corrupted version of her own ritual created by [Vecna](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Vecna "Vecna"). The light generated by the Rites of Catatheosis made the dusk sky become blue as daytime for a few minutes after its completion.

The rites were designed to allow the deities to be reborn as members of the many races that follow them, but when asked if it would work with creatures such as animals, the Raven Queen herself admitted that since it was all created in a hurry, there is a small chance of unusual exceptions.
