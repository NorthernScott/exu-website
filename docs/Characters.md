# Helga Hirscka (Nicole)

- Goliath
- Barbarian
- 25 years old
- 7-8 feet tall
- Intended Subclass: Path of the Wildheart
- Trinket: A single caltrop of bone. She carved it out of a bear bone. She has a set of dice made from the same bone. She made this because she had extra bone.
	- “She believes that every young girl should have her own set of dice carved from bear bones.”
- Soldier Background, because she helped to guard the livestock.
- Feels like she’s “aging out” of marriageable age.
- Ki’Nau, from Doralle Woods, village near the lake.
- Goliath barbarian named Helga (she/her), possibly Wildheart
- She derives her strength from her identification with wild animals
- Her rage is more animalistic than angry; she’s not an angry person
- Stone Giant ancestry; comes from a more mountainous area
- Slavic accent
- Comes from a small village where folks keep to themselves; somewhat isolate; predatory animals; farming village; value strength and self-reliance.
- She had to guard livestock from predators
- **Why did she leave her village to become an adventurer?** Could be something happened in the world that caused the village to disband or move? A “sillier” alternative is that she doesn’t feel she has any good marriage prospects at home and is out in search of a strong man and maybe a future?
- Thinks it would be hilarious to have her eventually fall in love with a really weak wizard. Maybe a love triangle between her, a nerdy guy, and an Adonis?
- Doesn’t really want to get married, it’s just “the next thing” and she hasn’t questioned it yet.
- Parents are dead, just of old age and/or disease.
- Has a younger brother, 15 years old.
- She’s left him in the village but he is far from alone.
- Their village is very communal.
- She is “looking for a spouse,” but really she is avoiding marriage.
- She is a worshipper of Kord, god of storms and strength and bravery.
	- She wants to be strong, self-reliant, brave.
	- She is looking for something but doesn’t know what
	- “She wants to live in the woods with her chickens and wrestle bears.”
	- “Kind of a Ron Swanson type.”
	- She is Lawful Neutral, so she actually is big on rules
- She’s recently arrived in Nicodranas and finds it very overwhelming and weird. She feels very out of place.
- She has a certain amount of disdain for the people, and thinks the men are weak and soft. But is also intrigued by the comforts of the place.
- Really think that the party should meet at the Lavish Chateau.

# Lucian Sugea (Spencer)

- Half-Human / Half-High Elf
- Sugea means “Serpent” in Basque.
- His mom is definitely a warlock of Uk’otoa.
	- Is she Avantika reincarnated??
- Aberrant Mind Sorcerer is top of mind.
	- His power is somehow connected to Uk’otoa.
	- His mom made some sort of a deal with Uk’otoa to gain power?
	- He probably doesn’t know where his power comes from or about his mom’s deal.
- Second or third son of a rich, noble family.
- Trinket: A tear-dropped shaped silver earring, with a hole in the middle, with a blue teardrop shaped cut glass gem in the middle, containing some sort of liquid. Stolen from his mom.
- Shitty Rich Kid.
- Gives only child energy but has one much younger brother, name unknown, about 8 years old, who hangs out with dad.
- Mom is the Marquess of Nicodranas.
- His dad is a rough and ready sailor.
- Only allegiance is to cash?
- Expected to perform some familial duty and is either bad at it or hates it?
- The aberrant mind class could speak to him being too weird.
- Has the Cloak of Many Fashions.
- Menagerie Coast.
- Avandra - the Changebringer - is their patron deity.
- Speaks Abyssal but doesn’t even know it.
- 17-19 years old
- Keeps having dreams about drowning.
- Edgelord?
- Shin is his “Cool Babysitter,” cool teacher, neat older sister.
- His family were sailor merchants, reasonably prosperous, but not among the upper echelon of the Nicodranian society. This all changed suddenly in the past 3-5 years when his mother ascended to the throne of Marquess very suddenly and through somewhat obscure means.
	- It’s not that he isn’t curious about how his mother did this, but it’s all kinda vague and the stories don’t really hang together.
	- His father is still very much a sailor at heart and is not a political animal. He owns a ship (more than one) and has taken to spending a lot of his time at sea.
- He wants to do “it” on his own. What that means exactly is kinda non-specific.
	- Probably wants to succeed in business, but doesn’t want to do it within the context of his family because he wants to do it himself.
	- He has at this point just completed his first successful business deal and is on top of the world.
	- He may not have even made it out of the Opal Arches.
	- Now that he has some money of his own, he is trying to be disciplined, but is also celebrating. Second generation wealth.
- His earliest connection with his abilities was his ability to convince people of things. He can consciously cast magic but hides it. He thinks that Shin doesn’t know the full extent of his abilities.
- Is his mom arranging marriages for him? Does she even care?
- He’s not really interested. Maybe he turns off suitors?

# Ada Glowsword (Lindsay)

- Gnome, Female, 80
- Wizard
- Acolyte Background
- Intended Subclass: Abjuration??
- Trinket: A small box of different buttons. Doesn’t remember how she got them. Doesn’t know why she keeps them.
- Acolyte of the Cobalt Soul, joined as a young teen (45 or 50)
- Born and raised in Zadash
- Mage associated with the Cobalt Soul
- Her family is working class, blue collar. TBD
- Big honour for her to be accepted as a student into the Cobalt Soul
- She thought it was cool to be accepted because she is smart and thought it was “a good fit” but she may not have strong feelings about the institution.
	- Not so much “yay CS” more “yay learning.”
- What are her feelings toward the Cobalt Soul now? Is she working toward joining a wizard order within it, or does she not care, etc?
- She is in Nicodranas because she was sent by the Cobalt Soul.
	- Maybe she was sent to find Ioun?
	- Maybe she’s encountered Lucian and thinks he could be a god? Maybe he is.
- Young and curious. Gets into trouble.

# Alarise “Stormshore” (Adam)

- Human, Female, Monk, 23
- Monk of Raven Queen
- Intended Subclass: Open Hand
- Upper middle class suburban background
- Typical upbringing.
- Private school, Jesuits but for the Raven Queen.
- From Zadash
- Trinket: A small rectangular metal box with cups on one end that throws sparks when wet. Basically a 9-volt battery.
	- How did she get this? Stolen from the house of a girl she didn’t like at a house party in school. Probably belonged to her parents.
- Enjoyed the religious community at the school.
- Found the community there deeper and more honest than her upbringing.
- Not an ascetic order. Very work hard / play hard.
- They are also not cloistered. They do send people out to do things.
- Parents are alive. They are scribes by trade. Accountants, professional services.
- Her parents sent her to school but did not expect her to become a Monk devotee of the Goddess of Death. They probably think that this is a phase and are just happy that she’s doing something with her life.
- She has 3 outfits. Street clothes, little black dress, black catsuit.
- Only child.
- She has gone to Nicodranas because the order sent her there. She is feeling like an outcast again.
- She is feeling great about being on the Menagerie Coast. But this is maybe in tension with what she is starting to feel is a real calling to the service of the Raven Queen.
- Why was she sent to Nicodranas? Looking for the Raven Queen? Something more…aggressive?

# Shin Cherou (Beth)

- Hobgoblin
- Intended Sublass: Life Domain
- Cleric of Avandra

- Born and raised in Nicodranas
- 34 years old, female
- Oldest of 3 children. Two younger siblings, a sister and a brother.

	- When the new marquess took over, she’s just stayed.

	- Lucian reminds her of her younger brother and she naturally gravitated toward looking after him.
	- She became one of his tutors.
	- Lucian’s mom asked her to look after him. Like a paid friend.
	- Shin 100% knows more about Lucian’s powers than Lucian does. “He certainly hasn’t been studying wizard magic, and he’s not faithful enough to be granted spells by Avandra. In fact, I KNOW that Avandra isn’t the source of his power.”
	- She is “Happy” for him for his power, but is deeply concerned that he could be a warlock of some kind.
	- His powers manifested first when he was about 9-11. Shin was about 26.
	- She is certainly feels like he’s a younger brother.
- Her younger brother (22M) is a punk who doesn’t appreciate anything.
- Her younger sister (30F) is more level-headed. She probably stayed home to help out.
