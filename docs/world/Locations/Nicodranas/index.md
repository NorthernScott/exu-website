# Nicodranas

## Overview

Nicodranas is the easternmost port city in the Menagerie Coast. Along with Port Damali it bookends the Menagerie Coast, although Nicodranas is approximately half the size of Port Damali. The city has colourful rooftops and towers vary in height and design, giving an eclectic visual of a jumble of cultures having built this space without a unified vision.

The city exterior wall has many gates and archways with portcullises that are held up by a chain mechanism beyond the wall. The gates are guarded by [Zhelezo](../../factions/clovis-concord.md#Zhelezo), who provide policing and security in the city. Towards the coastline, the walls slowly diminish in steps and extend out into the ocean. The walls beyond the exterior were once grey, but through the years of accumulating seagull excrement they became light grey with white patterns. The docks on the eastern and western sides of the city are the Restless Wharf and the Open Quay.

## Neighbourhoods

### Restless Wharf

On the eastern side of the city’s docks is the Restless Wharf, a busy but very tightly run dockyard surrounded by taverns and other cheap entertainments. Alongside the docks are warehouses, small huts, buildings and cranes. The cranes are made of wood, cord and rope, differing in size from 10 to 30 feet. They are often used, loading and off-loading various materials from the trade ships that are making their way into the harbour or loading up to leave. There are two or three larger guild buildings that are hubs of information for those that are coming from the docks. Walking around the docks are dockmasters gathering information on the ships that are coming and going, and making sure that everything is being handled appropriately.

#### Mother’s Lighthouse

A temple to the Wildmother located in the centre of the harbour. [Lightkeeper Gladys](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Gladys "Gladys") had been keeping the temple for the entire 86 years that she had spent in Nicodranas. It sits on a rock that protrudes where the docks come to an end and the stone continues out before breaking off into a shelf into the ocean below. On a gradual tower-like point on the back side facing the ocean is a 20-foot relief of the upper torso of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse looking out over the ocean, a beautiful sculpture with wild and tangled hair that curls around her shoulders. As the light beacon rotates, the eyes of the woman flare up as the light passes that side of the tower.

On the Top Floor are no windows, but there is a metal structure that holds up the 15-by-15-foot dome making up the ceiling. Each of the openings between the metal rods are where the light protrudes. In the center of the floor is a rough-cut, quartz-like crystal that’s three-and-a-half to four feet in diameter. Every day the lightkeeper needs to invoke the Mother’s blessing on the stone to ensure that the light guides the ships back to safe shore.

Leaning against the edge of the tower is a spyglass to look at people down below. The view from the top is of everything around, the harbour, the ocean and the shoreline, the fields and rolling hills that surround Nicodranas, the Cyrios Mountains to the north, and far to the east the Quoraska Jungle that vanish up the sides of the Ashkeeper Peaks. It’s a tremendous view the entire city below as well.

#### Wayfarer’s Cove

A tavern that caters to the working person. Decorated with flotsam and bits of shipwrecks and detritus, the interior has no music, just whispers and conversation. The smell is not pleasant and hits immediately, a mix of mossy musk from waterlogged wood, liquor and ale that have been spilled and left to stain the wood where it lies, and unwashed bodies. The bar is tended by a rather crotchety looking half-elf named **Xeno Michals**; he is scarred on one side of his face, a bit heavy set for a half-elf, with a small paunch and a soft chin and jawline.

[Orly Skiffback](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Orly_Skiffback) still frequents this tavern.

#Tavern

#### The Wharf Load

One of the larger center parts of the dock that juts out into the harbour a good hundred feet. There is a central dock house where a lot of the business is conducted. Inside are a handful of Zhelezo and folks that are filing out big leather books, ledgers, and receipt books of various people travelling through. There is a table with a bunch of papers rolled out, charting maps and large assembled lists of previous excursions. This is the place where the Harbourmaster works.

#### Meandering Treasures

A place someone could sell items. They tend to pay, maybe not top change, but quickly. **Deezma** is the proprietor of this shop.

#CurioShop

### Open Quay

The Open Quay is located on the western side of the docks. The Open Quay is the only part of Nicodranas not under the control of the Clovis Concord. It is a little bit smaller and seems to be less organized.

#### Tidepeak Tower

**[Tidepeak](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Tidepeak "Tidepeak"):** A strange tower which sits in the center of the Open Quay and is owned by [Yussa Errenis](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Yussa_Errenis "Yussa Errenis") a mage who is (possibly) at odds with the [Clovis Concord](<https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Clovis_Concord> “Clovis Concord”).

#### Seafloor’s Bounty

**[Seafloor's Bounty](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Seafloor%27s_Bounty "Seafloor's Bounty"):** General store run by a gnome named [Sheila Bobsnopper](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Sheila_Bobsnopper "Sheila Bobsnopper").

#### The Withered Bird Inn

Popular inn among the sailors that come through Nicodranas. Run by an ex-pirate black-scale Dragonborn named **Calthealud Jinzire**. Poor to modest inn and tavern. They have one or two ales, including *von Brandt* ale from Trostenwald, a morning plate and an evening plate, and a locally famous “century” seafood stew that has been boiling continuously - supposedly for over 100 years. They have two double rooms that can be had for a higher price, or beds in a common dorm for less.

#### Stone’s Throw Shipping

The Nicodranas office of the shipping company headquartered in [Port Damali](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Port_Damali). One or two of their ships are frequently in port and exclusively dock in the Open Quay.

- Wayward Accent
- Rumblecusp Express
- Sapphire of the Sea (personal yacht of Jester Lavorre, co-owner of the company)
- [Nein Heroez](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Nein_Heroez "Nein Heroez") (personal yacht of Fjord Stone, co-owner of the company)

### The Opal Archways

The Opal Archways district of Nicodranas is the oldest district of the town. It is where the wealthier merchants and clientele seem to congregate. Nicodranas originally comprised only this district before it expanded outwards over time. There are eleven 15-foot tall stone archways marking this district. It has a gradual arch with a large gem embedded at its zenith. Along the street are poles that hold oil lanterns that give a faint flickering firelight through the dark cobblestone streets. Further in the district they give way to much more vibrant, magical baubles that hover about ten feet above in the air. The folks in this district appear to be well-dressed nobles, wearing a crushed silk-type clothing that is bright blues and purples, and jewellery of all sorts of gems and colours. There are various street buskers and performers on the roads.

#### Lavish Chateau

The [Lavish Chateau](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Lavish_Chateau "Lavish Chateau") is an esteemed hotel where the [Ruby of the Sea](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_of_the_Sea "Ruby of the Sea") used to perform. Now supposedly owned jointly by the Ruby and a mysterious businessman from Zadash who typically goes by “The Gentleman.” [Jester Lavorre](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Jester_Lavorre "Jester Lavorre") grew up in this hotel.

#### The Marquis Demesne

The palace where the Marquess of the city lives, along with a handful of diplomats. It is a somewhat gaudy palace in the Venetian style, with towers up to five stories tall, two at the front and one larger one in the back. It is a large building that is draped with white silk. It has a dull brass and orange-yellow stone with a sandstone base with about 40 rooms within the establishment. A lot of money has gone into its construction and it has been recently refurbished. There are about 40 or more Zhelezo keeping an eye on the vicinity.

#### Brenatto’s Better Self

[Brenatto's Better Self](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Brenatto%27s_Better_Self "The Brenatto's Better Self") is an apothecary in the southern sector of the Opal Archways district, owned and operated by [Yeza Brenatto](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Yeza_Brenatto "Yeza Brenatto").

#### Perfumery

An unnamed perfumery and incense shop. Run by…

#### The Verdant Veil - Enchanted Oddities & Arcane Fineries

Nestled between a perfumery “Brenatto’s Better Self” in the **Opal Archways**, the shop appears as a crooked teal-and-gold storefront tucked under a riot of hanging vines and glowing lantern-fruit. The doorway is shaped like an archway of twisting ivy, and the sign overhead reads in curling golden script:

> *The Verdant Veil*
> *“Mystery, Marvels, and Mildly Dangerous Wares.”*

Inside, the shop is much larger than it appears—thanks to **folded dimensional space**. It feels like walking through a greenhouse crossed with a wizard’s attic. Items hang from vines, float in jars, or skitter across shelves when not looking.

### 🧩 Potential Plot Hooks

- **The Living Mask**: A cursed item recently *escaped* its display and is causing chaos in the Archways. Dazz offers a hefty reward for its safe return—“but do *not* damage the theatrical finish!”
- **Suspicious Patron**: Dazz is unnerved by a recent customer who purchased “The Candle That Lies” but hasn’t left town. Might be connected to a local spy ring.
- **Backroom Invitation**: If the party impresses Dazz, they’re offered access to a *hidden backroom vault* of rarer and more dangerous magic—some of which might be “ethically questionable.”

### The Skew

It is the cheaper, more affordable residential area of town.

### The Sluice Weave Labyrinth
