# Nicodranas

## Overview

Nicodranas is the easternmost port city in the Menagerie Coast. Along with Port Damali it bookends the Menagerie Coast, although Nicodranas is approximately half the size of Port Damali. The city has colourful rooftops and towers vary in height and design, giving an eclectic visual of a jumble of cultures having built this space without a unified vision.

The city exterior wall has many gates and archways with portcullises that are held up by a chain mechanism beyond the wall. The gates are guarded by [Zhelezo](../../factions/clovis-concord.md#Zhelezo), who provide policing and security in the city. Towards the coastline, the walls slowly diminish in steps and extend out into the ocean. The walls beyond the exterior were once grey, but through the years of accumulating seagull excrement they became light grey with white patterns. The docks on the eastern and western sides of the city are the Restless Wharf and the Open Quay.

## Neighbourhoods

### Restless Wharf

On the eastern side of the city’s docks is the Restless Wharf, a busy but very tightly run dockyard surrounded by taverns and other cheap entertainments. Alongside the docks are warehouses, small huts, buildings and cranes. The cranes are made of wood, cord and rope, differing in size from 10 to 30 feet. They are often used, loading and off-loading various materials from the trade ships that are making their way into the harbour or loading up to leave. There are two or three larger guild buildings that are hubs of information for those that are coming from the docks. Walking around the docks are dockmasters gathering information on the ships that are coming and going, and making sure that everything is being handled appropriately.

#### Mother’s Lighthouse

A temple to the Wildmother located in the centre of the harbour. [Lightkeeper Gladys](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Gladys "Gladys") had been keeping the temple for the entire 86 years that she had spent in Nicodranas. It sits on a rock that protrudes where the docks come to an end and the stone continues out before breaking off into a shelf into the ocean below. On a gradual tower-like point on the back side facing the ocean is a 20-foot relief of the upper torso of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse looking out over the ocean, a beautiful sculpture with wild and tangled hair that curls around her shoulders. As the light beacon rotates, the eyes of the woman flare up as the light passes that side of the tower.

On the Top Floor are no windows, but there is a metal structure that holds up the 15-by-15-foot dome making up the ceiling. Each of the openings between the metal rods are where the light protrudes. In the center of the floor is a rough-cut, quartz-like crystal that’s three-and-a-half to four feet in diameter. Every day the lightkeeper needs to invoke the Mother’s blessing on the stone to ensure that the light guides the ships back to safe shore.

Leaning against the edge of the tower is a spyglass to look at people down below. The view from the top is of everything around, the harbour, the ocean and the shoreline, the fields and rolling hills that surround Nicodranas, the Cyrios Mountains to the north, and far to the east the Quoraska Jungle that vanish up the sides of the Ashkeeper Peaks. It’s a tremendous view the entire city below as well.

#### Wayfarer’s Cove

A tavern that caters to the working person. Decorated with flotsam and bits of shipwrecks and detritus, the interior has no music, just whispers and conversation. The smell is not pleasant and hits immediately, a mix of mossy musk from waterlogged wood, liquor and ale that have been spilled and left to stain the wood where it lies, and unwashed bodies. The bar is tended by a rather crotchety looking half-elf named **Xeno Michals**; he is scarred on one side of his face, a bit heavy set for a half-elf, with a small paunch and a soft chin and jawline.

#### The Wharf Load

One of the larger center parts of the dock that juts out into the harbour a good hundred feet. There is a central dock house where a lot of the business is conducted. Inside are a handful of Zhelezo and folks that are filing out big leather books, ledgers, and receipt books of various people travelling through. There is a table with a bunch of papers rolled out, charting maps and large assembled lists of previous excursions. This is the place where the Harbourmaster works.

#### Meandering Treasures

A place someone could sell items. They tend to pay, maybe not top change, but quickly. Deezma is the proprietor of this shop.

### The Skew

It is the cheaper, more affordable residential area of town.

### The Sluice Weave Labyrinth

Accessed by two submerged gates in the harbour.
