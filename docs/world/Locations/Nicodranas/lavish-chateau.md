# Lavish Chateau

![The entrance of the Lavish Chateau|200](../../../assets/images/lavish-chateau.png){ width=200, align=Right }

A beautiful, three-story, thin but very tall, sky blue stone building. Windows of the building have a gold-leafed wooden frame with deep cerulean, crushed velvet curtains that opens up across stained glass windows that emanate slightly shifting kaleidoscope of colour from the inside out. The front entrance is marked with steps that leads to double doors.
