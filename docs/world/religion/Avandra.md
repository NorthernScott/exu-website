## Overview

Avandra, the Changebringer, also known as “She Who Makes the Path”, is the goddess of freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and luck. She encourages her followers to venture into the unknown. Her nature leads to few temples dedicated to her in the centres of civilization, but they can be found near well travelled roads. Her worshippers include merchants, free spirits and adventurers.

The Changebringer is usually depicted as a dark-skinned young woman with light brown hair (sometimes silver) that changes into a road behind her, symbolic of the many possible roads ahead.

As a goddess of change and trickery Avandra can be very mercurial, and although she isn’t necessarily manipulative, she does change her approach to different issues, sending messages to her followers in different ways and tones in order to find the one that will resonate with them the most.

People who are not disciples of the Changebringer nevertheless sometimes pray to her to fare well on a journey. Like all prime deities, worship of the Changebringer is centered in Vasselheim. She also has major centres of worship in Tal’Dorei along the [Lucidian Coast](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Lucidian_Coast) and the [Rifenmist Peninsula](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Rifenmist_Peninsula "Rifenmist Peninsula") (outside the [Iron Authority](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Authority "Iron Authority"), which is dedicated to [the Strife Emperor](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Strife_Emperor "The Strife Emperor")). As of 843 PD, the cylindrical Horizon Temple in [Whitestone](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Whitestone "Whitestone") was dedicated to her. Additionally, because of her association with travel and trade, the Changebringer is widely worshipped along the [[Menagerie Coast]]. By contrast, the Changebringer is not one of the deities approved for worship in the Dwendalian Empire. Nevertheless, some continue to worship her in secret.
