## Overview

Ioun, the Knowing Mentor, also known as the Knowing Mistress, is the goddess of knowledge, prophecy, and skill.

The Knowing Mentor’s avatar appears as an older woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is weathered and wrinkled around her almond shaped eyes with purple irises. She wears blue and white robes that tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment. Her avatar has a large, darkened gash of black, curling void in her stomach.

The Knowing Mistress usually comes across as a kindly, and even rather tolerant deity. The one thing she is intolerant of (or perhaps impatient with) is the keeping of secrets and the hiding of knowledge.

Though the Knowing Mentor’s followers generally worship in private, as they are hunted by followers of her enemies, not all of her temples are secret. In Tal’Dorei, the Knowing Mentor has a minority following in the Verdant Expanse, and there are halls in which to worship the Knowing Mentor in Emon’s Temple District as well. In Wildemount, the Knowing Mistress is one of the six deities approved for worship within the Dwendalian Empire. And in Gwardan on the Menagerie Coast, the House of Enlightenment is both a temple to Ioun and a place of higher learning. Worshipped in ziggurat temples in the old days, the Knowing Mentor finds her current worshippers gathering not in conventional temples, but rather in libraries dedicated to furthering her goals of fostering knowledge and enlightenment.

> [!CITE] Commandments of the Knowing Mentor
>
 > 1. Unmask those who would destroy the Knowing Mentor. Learn their secrets and unveil them to the world.
 > 2. Uphold and teach the importance of reason, perception, and truth in guiding one’s emotions and path.
 > 3. Condemn those who lie without moral cause, for evil folk gain power when their followers obscure the truth. Never stoop to the level of selfish liars.
