Here are some ideas for the contents of \"Nana Morri's House\" and the encounters the players might face as they navigate this fey-themed attraction:\n\n### Initial Atmosphere\n- **Entrance Illusion:** As the players enter, they pass through a shimmering curtain that briefly reveals their reflections as fey creatures. This sets the tone for the magical and deceptive nature of the house.\n- **Shifting Walls:** The corridors of the house seem to shift and change, with doors appearing and disappearing, leading the players to question their sense of direction.\n\n### Skill Challenge: Navigating the Maze\n- **Living Vines:** The players must navigate a maze of corridors where the walls are made of living vines that shift and block paths. They need to use skills like Perception or Nature to find the correct path and avoid dead ends or traps.\n- **Illusory Traps:** The floor occasionally appears to open up into a bottomless pit, requiring the players to discern illusion from reality using Investigation or Arcana.\n\n### Roleplaying Encounter: The Fey Court\n- **Fey Courtroom:** The players stumble into a grand hall where a court of fey creatures, led by a mischievous pixie judge, accuses them of trespassing. The players must use Diplomacy or Deception to argue their case and avoid a whimsical punishment.\n- **Riddles and Games:** The fey court loves games and riddles. The players might have to solve a riddle or participate in a game of chance to win their freedom.\n\n### Combat Encounter: The Guardian of Ligament Manor\n- **Guardian Beast:** As the players near the exit, they encounter a guardian beast, such as a displacer beast or a blink dog, that has been enchanted to protect the manor. The players must defeat or outsmart the creature to escape.\n- **Environmental Hazards:** The room where the fight takes place is filled with magical hazards, like shifting platforms or bursts of wild magic, adding complexity to the battle.\n\n### Final Escape\n- **Portal Back to Reality:** After overcoming the encounters, the players find a portal that leads them back to the carnival. As they step through, they see the house revert to its fake carnival appearance, leaving them to wonder about the reality of their experience.\n\nThese ideas incorporate elements of illusion, enchantment, and the whimsical yet dangerous nature of the Feywild, reflecting the influence of Morrigan and the Feywild setting. Feel free to adjust these ideas to better fit your campaign and the dynamics of your player group!"

Here are some ideas for the \"fake\" rooms of Nana Morri's House, designed to initially appear as typical carnival attractions before transitioning into the more dangerous Feywild portion:\n\n### 1. The Hall of Mirrors\n- **Description:** A classic carnival attraction with distorted mirrors that stretch and shrink the players' reflections. \n- **Illusion:** Some mirrors might briefly show the players as fey creatures or in strange, otherworldly landscapes, hinting at the transition to the Feywild.\n\n### 2. The Haunted Parlor\n- **Description:** A room filled with dusty, old-fashioned furniture and cobwebs, with ghostly sounds playing in the background.\n- **Illusion:** Apparitions appear to be mechanical or projected, but occasionally, a real ghostly figure (a fey spirit) might flicker into view, unnoticed by most.\n\n### 3. The Trickster's Library\n- **Description:** Shelves filled with fake books and scrolls, some of which pop open with harmless surprises like confetti or fake spiders.\n- **Illusion:** One book might whisper secrets or riddles when opened, providing clues about the upcoming Feywild challenges.\n\n### 4. The Enchanted Garden\n- **Description:** A room decorated with artificial plants and flowers, some of which move or sing when approached.\n- **Illusion:** Occasionally, the plants seem to glow or change colors, hinting at their true magical nature.\n\n### 5. The Puppet Theater\n- **Description:** A small stage with marionettes performing a whimsical play. The puppets are controlled by visible strings and gears.\n- **Illusion:** At times, the puppets appear to move on their own, acting out scenes that eerily resemble the players' past or future actions.\n\n### 6. The Illusionist's Chamber\n- **Description:** A room filled with props for magic tricks, such as disappearing boxes and levitation platforms.\n- **Illusion:** Some tricks seem too real, like a disappearing act where a player briefly vanishes and sees a glimpse of the Feywild before returning.\n\nThese rooms are designed to provide a playful and intriguing experience, gradually introducing elements of magic and mystery that foreshadow the transition to the Feywild. Players might initially dismiss the strange occurrences as clever tricks, only to realize the deeper magic at play as they progress through the house."

One of the attractions is Nana Morri’s House, described as a fey-themed fun-house.\n\nIn the Critical Role universe, Morrigan is a fey entity known as the \"Fey Queen\" or \"Mother of Ravens,\" associated with the Feywild. She is a powerful and enigmatic figure who has appeared in various Critical Role campaigns. If Nana Morri’s House is inspired by Morrigan, it might incorporate elements of the Feywild, such as illusions, enchantments, and mysterious or whimsical features that reflect Morrigan's influence.\n\nTo further explore this connection, you might consider how the atmosphere and events in Nana Morri’s House could reflect Morrigan's characteristics or themes from the Feywild. For example, you could include illusions or challenges that test the players' wits, or encounters with creatures or characters that serve Morrigan.\n\nIf you have specific aspects of Morrigan or the Feywild you want to incorporate into your adventure, feel free to share, and I can help brainstorm ideas or connections!",

These notes contain details of my party's player-characters: /docs/the-party/. These notes contain details of the world specific to my campaign:/docs/world/. This is a wiki with information about Critical Role's Exandria campaign setting, which is where my campaign is set: https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/.\n\nThis is the setup for how the adventure begins:\n\n- The players are all in Nicodranas. Lucien and Shin know each other well - Shin has been Lucien's au pair since he was small - and they are wandering the market together. Lucien has just completed a successful trade and is flush with cash.\n- Helga has just arrived in the city, is likewise in the market, and has just bought some roasted chicken for lunch.\n- Ada and Alarise met on the road 2 days earlier as they were coming through the Wuyun Gates and, since they are both from Zadash they decided to travel together. They entered the city this morning and are in the Open Quay market looking for an inn.\n\nThe players all notice that a carnival is in town and independently find themselves drawn to line up for the attraction called \"Nana Morri's House.\" This attraction is a \"haunted house\" type attraction based on the house of the archfey Morrigan (aka the \"Fate Stitcher\"), Ligament Manor. The house starts as an obviously fake carnival attraction, but gradually becomes more \"real,\" until it becomes clear that the characters have wandered into some portion of the Feywild  and are in danger. They will then have to solve 3 encounters - a skill challenge, a roleplaying encounter, and a fight - before they can escape.\n\nCan you please help me brainstorm ideas for the contents of this house and the kind of things they will encounter in it?"

      "content": "Certainly! Here are some ideas for the contents of \"Nana Morri's House\" and the encounters the players might face as they navigate this fey-themed attraction:\n\n### Initial Atmosphere\n- **Entrance Illusion:** As the players enter, they pass through a shimmering curtain that briefly reveals their reflections as fey creatures. This sets the tone for the magical and deceptive nature of the house.\n- **Shifting Walls:** The corridors of the house seem to shift and change, with doors appearing and disappearing, leading the players to question their sense of direction.\n\n### Skill Challenge: Navigating the Maze\n- **Living Vines:** The players must navigate a maze of corridors where the walls are made of living vines that shift and block paths. They need to use skills like Perception or Nature to find the correct path and avoid dead ends or traps.\n- **Illusory Traps:** The floor occasionally appears to open up into a bottomless pit, requiring the players to discern illusion from reality using Investigation or Arcana.\n\n### Roleplaying Encounter: The Fey Court\n- **Fey Courtroom:** The players stumble into a grand hall where a court of fey creatures, led by a mischievous pixie judge, accuses them of trespassing. The players must use Diplomacy or Deception to argue their case and avoid a whimsical punishment.\n- **Riddles and Games:** The fey court loves games and riddles. The players might have to solve a riddle or participate in a game of chance to win their freedom.\n\n### Combat Encounter: The Guardian of Ligament Manor\n- **Guardian Beast:** As the players near the exit, they encounter a guardian beast, such as a displacer beast or a blink dog, that has been enchanted to protect the manor. The players must defeat or outsmart the creature to escape.\n- **Environmental Hazards:** The room where the fight takes place is filled with magical hazards, like shifting platforms or bursts of wild magic, adding complexity to the battle.\n\n### Final Escape\n- **Portal Back to Reality:** After overcoming the encounters, the players find a portal that leads them back to the carnival. As they step through, they see the house revert to its fake carnival appearance, leaving them to wonder about the reality of their experience.\n\nThese ideas incorporate elements of illusion, enchantment, and the whimsical yet dangerous nature of the Feywild, reflecting the influence of Morrigan and the Feywild setting. Feel free to adjust these ideas to better fit your campaign and the dynamics of your player group!",

Here are some ideas for the \"fake\" rooms of Nana Morri's House, designed to initially appear as typical carnival attractions before transitioning into the more dangerous Feywild portion:\n\n### 1. The Hall of Mirrors\n- **Description:** A classic carnival attraction with distorted mirrors that stretch and shrink the players' reflections. \n- **Illusion:** Some mirrors might briefly show the players as fey creatures or in strange, otherworldly landscapes, hinting at the transition to the Feywild.\n\n### 2. The Haunted Parlor\n- **Description:** A room filled with dusty, old-fashioned furniture and cobwebs, with ghostly sounds playing in the background.\n- **Illusion:** Apparitions appear to be mechanical or projected, but occasionally, a real ghostly figure (a fey spirit) might flicker into view, unnoticed by most.\n\n### 3. The Trickster's Library\n- **Description:** Shelves filled with fake books and scrolls, some of which pop open with harmless surprises like confetti or fake spiders.\n- **Illusion:** One book might whisper secrets or riddles when opened, providing clues about the upcoming Feywild challenges.\n\n### 4. The Enchanted Garden\n- **Description:** A room decorated with artificial plants and flowers, some of which move or sing when approached.\n- **Illusion:** Occasionally, the plants seem to glow or change colors, hinting at their true magical nature.\n\n### 5. The Puppet Theater\n- **Description:** A small stage with marionettes performing a whimsical play. The puppets are controlled by visible strings and gears.\n- **Illusion:** At times, the puppets appear to move on their own, acting out scenes that eerily resemble the players' past or future actions.\n\n### 6. The Illusionist's Chamber\n- **Description:** A room filled with props for magic tricks, such as disappearing boxes and levitation platforms.\n- **Illusion:** Some tricks seem too real, like a disappearing act where a player briefly vanishes and sees a glimpse of the Feywild before returning.\n\nThese rooms are designed to provide a playful and intriguing experience, gradually introducing elements of magic and mystery that foreshadow the transition to the Feywild. Players might initially dismiss the strange occurrences as clever tricks, only to realize the deeper magic at play as they progress through the house.",
