They need to use skills like Perception or Nature to find the correct path and avoid dead ends or traps.\n- **Illusory Traps:** The floor occasionally appears to open up into a bottomless pit, requiring the players to discern illusion from reality using Investigation or Arcana.\n\n### Roleplaying Encounter: The Fey Court\n- **Fey Courtroom:** The players stumble into a grand hall where a court of fey creatures, led by a mischievous pixie judge, accuses them of trespassing.

The players must defeat or outsmart the creature to escape.\n- **Environmental Hazards:** The room where the fight takes place is filled with magical hazards, like shifting platforms or bursts of wild magic, adding complexity to the battle.\n\n### Final Escape\n- **Portal Back to Reality:** After overcoming the encounters, the players find a portal that leads them back to the carnival. As they step through, they see the house revert to its fake carnival appearance, leaving them to wonder about the reality of their experience.\n\nThese ideas incorporate elements of illusion, enchantment, and the whimsical yet dangerous nature of the Feywild, reflecting the influence of Morrigan and the Feywild setting.
